   abstract            = {The success of diffusion MRI is deeply rooted in
                         the fact that during their micrometric random
                         displacements water molecules explore tissue
                         microstructure. Hence by labeling magnetically
                         spins of displaced water, diffusion MRI provides
                         us with exquisite information about the sizes and
                         orientations on the multiple compartments present
                         inside an imaging voxel. Through the causal
                         relation between on one hand the imaged
                         restricted and oriented water mobility and on the
                         other hand the axonal orientations in brain white
                         matter, diffusion MRI has become a powerful
                         method to infer fiber tract architecture and
                         brain anatomic connectivity. This work is not
                         only a journey that takes us from essential
                         diffusion MRI physics to an investigation of the
                         brain neuronal circuitry, but also a thesis
                         aiming at demonstrating the power of large scale
                         analysis of brain connectivity, where every
                         technological component is essential. After a
                         short introduction on molecular diffusion and
                         diffusion NMR, we start by showing that diffusion
                         contrast is positive. This key issue that was
                         only postulated up to now, allows us to justify
                         why diffusion can be computed accurately with the
                         only signal modulus. Accordingly, various
                         emerging MRI techniques that map non-Gaussian
                         diffusion have found a sound justification. In
                         particular it is precisely the result that allows
                         us to map distribution of diffusion related spin
                         displacements by Fourier transformation of the
                         measured signal modulus, hence to do Diffusion
                         Spectrum MRI. We show through multiples MR
                         experiments how the shape of this distribution in
                         a complicated multi-compartment biological system
                         can be measured and how its characteristic local
                         heterogeneity is a mirror of fiber architectures.
                         We discuss in detail its interpretation and its
                         relation to other diffusion MRI techniques.
                         Tractography is the necessary link that from
                         diffusion MRI provides us with nerve fiber
                         trajectories and maps of brain axonal
                         connectivity. In this thesis two algorithms are
                         proposed, while the first is designed for
                         diffusion tensor MRI, the second is shaped for
                         high angular resolution diffusion MRI and
                         specifically tested on Diffusion Spectrum MRI.
                         After having considered the potentials and the
                         limitations of these line generation algorithms,
                         we investigate whether tractography can be
                         formulated as a segmentation problem in a high
                         dimensional non Euclidean space, i.e.
                         position-orientation space. With the help of the
                         developed tools we address some key
                         neuro-scientific questions. Based on diffusion
                         tensor MRI data of 32 healthy volunteers,
                         language networks are investigated. It is shown
                         that right-handed men are massively
                         interconnected between the left-hemisphere speech
                         areas whereas the homologous in the right
                         hemisphere are sparse; furthermore
                         interhemispheric connections between the speech
                         areas and their contralatera1 homologues are
                         relatively strong. Women and left-handed men have
                         equally strong intrahemispheric connections in
                         both hemispheres, but women have a higher density
                         of interhemispheric connections. After this
                         quantitative study, Diffusion Spectrum MRI data
                         of a single subject is collected and tractography
                         performed in order to analyze the global
                         connectivity pattern of the human brain. For this
                         purpose we propose to model this large scale
                         architecture by an abstract graph. It is shown
                         that the long-range axonal network exhibits a
                         "small world" topology. This type of particular
                         architecture is present in various large scale
                         communication networks. They emerge usually from
                         a growing process where optimal communication has
                         to be developed under some resource constraints.
                         Furthermore we show also that the architecture of
                         axonal connectivity between cortical areas
                         exhibits a hierarchical organization. These
                         results, which confirm more indirect studies,
                         provide essential material to discuss not only
                         brain evolution and development but also
                         information processing at the level of the brain.},

	among the three subject groups. Nonetheless, there were intact prefrontal
	and temporal networks in elderly controls and AD patients, as well.
	The analysis shows that although the topologies of the MST characterized
	by the degree distributions do not differ significantly among the
	groups, the DMN of the AD patients exhibits a higher segregation,
	insomuch that posterior cingulate/precuneus and hippocampus/parahippocampus
	are heavily isolated from rest of the network. We conclude that the

	can potentially affect the performance of disease classification.
	A total of 518 MRI sessions from 226 healthy controls and 191 individuals
	with probable AD from the multicenter Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
	Initiative (ADNI) were used to investigate whether grouping data
	by acquisition hardware (i.e. vendor, field strength, coil system)
	is beneficial for the performance of a support vector machine (SVM)
	classifier, compared to the case where data from different hardware
	is mixed. We compared the change of the SVM decision value resulting
	from (a) changes in hardware against the effect of disease and (b)
	changes resulting simply from rescanning the same subject on the
	same machine. Maximum accuracy of 87\% was obtained with a training
	set of all 417 subjects. Classifiers trained with 95 subjects in
	each diagnostic group and acquired with heterogeneous scanner settings
	had an empirical detection accuracy of 84.2$\pm$2.4\% when tested
	on an independent set of the same size. These results mirror the
	accuracy reported in recent studies. Encouragingly, classifiers trained
	on images acquired with homogenous and heterogeneous hardware settings
	had equivalent cross-validation performances. Two scans of the same
	subject acquired on the same machine had very similar decision values
	and were generally classified into the same group. Higher variation
	was introduced when two acquisitions of the same subject were performed
	on two scanners with different field strengths. The variation was
	unbiased and similar for both diagnostic groups. The findings of
	the study encourage the pooling of data from different sites to increase
	the number of training samples and thereby improving performance
	of disease classifiers. Although small, a change in hardware could
	lead to a change of the decision value and thus diagnostic grouping.
	The findings of this study provide estimators for diagnostic accuracy
	of an automated disease diagnosis method involving scans acquired
	with different sets of hardware. Furthermore, we show that the level
	of confidence in the performance estimation significantly depends
	on the size of the training sample, and hence should be taken into

	Granger causality to the right motor cortex existed from bilateral

	to the SMA existed from right auditory cortex in 7 subjects and from

	core of highly connected hubs and had an exponentially truncated
	power law degree distribution. Hubs included recently evolved regions

	in terms of three primary outcome measures: time course spectral
	power, spatial map intensity, and functional network connectivity.
	Results revealed robust effects of age on all three outcome measures,
	largely indicating decreases in network coherence and connectivity
	with increasing age. Gender effects were of smaller magnitude but

	cortico-limbic activity and connectivity may underlie the pathophysiology
	of MDD. In this study, using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
	(fMRI), we investigated differences in cortico-limbic activity and
	connectivity between depressed patients and healthy controls. METHODS:
	Fifteen unmedicated unipolar depressed patients and 15 matched healthy
	subjects underwent fMRI during which they first completed a conventional
	block-design activation experiment in which they were exposed to
	negative and neutral pictures. Next, low frequency blood oxygenation
	dependent (BOLD) related fluctuations (LFBF) data were acquired at
	rest and during steady-state exposure to neutral, positive and negative
	pictures. LFBF correlations were calculated between anterior cingulate
	cortex (ACC) and limbic regions--amygdala (AMYG), pallidostriatum
	(PST) and medial thalamus (MTHAL) and used as a measure of cortico-limbic
	connectivity. RESULTS: Depressed patients had increased activation
	of cortical and limbic regions. At rest and during exposure to neutral,
	positive, and negative pictures cortico-limbic LFBF correlations
	were decreased in depressed patients compared to healthy subjects.
	CONCLUSIONS: The finding of increased activation of limbic regions

	by studying locations in the brain that exhibit temporal intensity
	variation between groups, frequently reporting classification accuracy
	of 90\% or better. Although empirical results are quite favorable,
	one might doubt the ability of classification methods to withstand
	changes in task ordering and the reproducibility of activation patterns
	over runs, and question how much of the classification machines'
	power is due to artifactual noise versus genuine neurological signal.
	To examine the true strength and power of machine learning classifiers
	we create and then deconstruct a classifier to examine its sensitivity
	to physiological noise, task reordering, and across-scan classification
	ability. The models are trained and tested both within and across
	runs to assess stability and reproducibility across conditions. We
	demonstrate the use of independent components analysis for both feature
	extraction and artifact removal and show that removal of such artifacts
	can reduce predictive accuracy even when data has been cleaned in
	the preprocessing stages. We demonstrate how mistakes in the feature
	selection process can cause the cross-validation error seen in publication
	to be a biased estimate of the testing error seen in practice and
	measure this bias by purposefully making flawed models. We discuss
	other ways to introduce bias and the statistical assumptions lying
	behind the data and model themselves. Finally we discuss the complications
	in drawing inference from the smaller sample sizes typically seen
	in fMRI studies, the effects of small or unbalanced samples on the
	Type 1 and Type 2 error rates, and how publication bias can give
	a false confidence of the power of such methods. Collectively this
	work identifies challenges specific to fMRI classification and methods
	affecting the stability of models.}},

	the present study manipulated factors that promote spontaneous cognition

	Results revealed that the default network increased its activity
	when spontaneous cognition was maximized but not when participants
	increased their attention to unpredictable foveal or peripheral stimuli.
	To examine the nature of participants' spontaneous thoughts, a second
	experiment used self-report questionnaires to quantify spontaneous

	a more global view of brain function. Synthetic PET allows us to
	integrate human and monkey studies in the construction of more complete
	models of the neural mechanisms used by both species in similar tasks.

	Functional connectivity, which is demonstrated in the "resting brain,"

  abstract = {{ The most influential theory to explain the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's
	disease (AD) has been the "Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis" (ACH) first
	formulated in 1992. The ACH proposes that the deposition of β-amyloid
	(Aβ) is the initial pathological event in AD leading to the formation
	of senile plaques (SPs) and then to neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)
	death of neurons, and ultimately dementia. This paper examines two
	questions regarding the ACH: (1) is there a relationship between
	the pathogenesis of SPs and NFTs, and (2) what is the relationship
	of these lesions to disease pathogenesis? These questions are examined
	in relation to studies of the morphology and molecular determinants
	of SPs and NFTs, the effects of gene mutation, degeneration induced
	by head injury, the effects of experimentally induced brain lesions,
	transgenic studies, and the degeneration of anatomical pathways.
	It was concluded that SPs and NFTs develop independently and may

	In this paper, we present the construction of 20 realistic digital
	brain phantoms that can be used to simulate medical imaging data.
	The phantoms are made from 20 normal adults to take into account
	intersubject anatomical variabilities. Each digital brain phantom
	was created by registering and averaging four T1, T2, and proton
	density (PD)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from
	each subject. A fuzzy minimum distance classification was used to
	classify voxel intensities from T1, T2, and PD average volumes into
	grey-matter, white matter, cerebro-spinal fluid, and fat. Automatically
	generated mask volumes were required to separate brain from nonbrain
	structures and ten fuzzy tissue volumes were created: grey matter,
	white matter, cerebro-spinal fluid, skull, marrow within the bone,
	dura, fat, tissue around the fat, muscles, and skin/muscles. A fuzzy
	vessel class was also obtained from the segmentation of the magnetic
	resonance angiography scan of the subject. These eleven fuzzy volumes
	that describe the spatial distribution of anatomical tissues define
	the digital phantom, where voxel intensity is proportional to the
	fraction of tissue within the voxel. These fuzzy volumes can be used
	to drive simulators for different modalities including MRI, PET,
	or SPECT. These phantoms were used to construct 20 simulated T1-weighted
	MR scans. To evaluate the realism of these simulations, we propose
	two approaches to compare them to real data acquired with the same
	acquisition parameters. The first approach consists of comparing
	the intensities within the segmented classes in both real and simulated
	data. In the second approach, a whole brain voxel-wise comparison
	between simulations and real T1-weighted data is performed. The first
	comparison underlines that segmented classes appear to properly represent
	the anatomy on average, and that inside these classes, the simulated
	and real intensity values are quite similar. The second comparison
	enables the study of the regional variations with no a priori class.
	The experiments demonstrate that these variations are small when
	real data are corrected for intensity nonuniformity.}},

	However, static images of brain regions activated during particular
	tasks do not convey the information of how these regions communicate
	with each other. In this study, advanced methods for the estimation
	of cortical connectivity from combined high-resolution electroencephalography
	(EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data are presented.
	These methods include a subject's multicompartment head model (scalp,
	skull, dura mater, cortex) constructed from individual magnetic resonance
	images, multidipole source model, and regularized linear inverse
	source estimates of cortical current density. Determination of the
	priors in the resolution of the linear inverse problem was performed
	with the use of information from the hemodynamic responses of the
	cortical areas as revealed by block-designed (strength of activated
	voxels) fMRI. We estimate functional cortical connectivity by computing
	the directed transfer function (DTF) on the estimated cortical current
	density waveforms in regions of interest (ROIs) on the modeled cortical
	mantle. The proposed method was able to unveil the direction of the
	information flow between the cortical regions of interest, as it
	is directional in nature. Furthermore, this method allows to detect
	changes in the time course of information flow between cortical regions
	in different frequency bands. The reliability of these techniques
	was further demonstrated by elaboration of high-resolution EEG and
	fMRI signals collected during visually triggered finger movements
	in four healthy subjects. Connectivity patterns estimated for this

	and prefrontal cortical areas. This cortical region involvement resembles

	cingulate cortex (PCC) is believed to have a key role in a default
	network and be involved in the pathophysiology of AD, few studies
	have investigated whole-brain functional connectivity of PCC during
	resting state, or investigated the relationship between abnormal
	functional connectivity and disturbance in cognitive function in
	aMCI patients. Resting-state functional connectivity analysis was
	used to examine the temporal correlation between PCC and whole-brain
	regions in 30 aMCI patients and 26 well-matched controls. Further
	analysis involved evaluation of possible relationships between functional
	connectivity measures and cognitive function. Regions of decreased
	functional connectivity were identified in aMCI patients, most notably
	in temporal cortex, whilst significantly increased functional connectivity
	was mainly in frontal cortex. In addition, functional connectivity
	of PCC and temporal cortex was associated with the performance of
	neuropsychological tests in aMCI patients. This would be consonant
	with the recruitment of compensatory mechanisms and the process of
	offset functional impairments appearing as neuropathologic develops,
	and resting-state connectivity disturbance of PCC--temporal cortex

  abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The literature reports considerable variation in the rates
	of psychiatric morbidity for patients with dementia with Lewy bodies.
	The authors intended to clarify the frequency of psychiatric morbidity
	in dementia with Lewy bodies and how it differs from probable Alzheimer's
	disease. METHOD: The study incorporated two groups--a clinical case
	register cohort (98 with dementia with Lewy bodies; 92 with Alzheimer's
	disease) and 80 (40 with dementia with Lewy bodies; 40 with Alzheimer's
	disease) prospectively studied, neuropathologically confirmed cases.
	Diagnoses were made by using the McKeith et al. consensus criteria
	for dementia with Lewy bodies and the National Institute of Neurological
	and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease
	and Related Disorders Association criteria for Alzheimer's disease.
	Neuropathological diagnoses were made by using the consensus criteria
	for dementia with Lewy bodies and the Mirra et al. protocol for Alzheimer's
	disease. RESULTS: The occurrence of psychiatric symptoms was reported
	over 1 month. Hallucinations, depression, delusions, and delusional
	misidentification were all significantly higher for patients with
	dementia with Lewy bodies. The differences in frequency between dementia
	with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease for auditory and visual
	hallucinations were especially pronounced for patients with mild
	cognitive impairment. The presence of psychiatric symptoms at presentation
	was a better discriminator between dementia with Lewy bodies and
	Alzheimer's disease than occurrence over the course of dementia.
	CONCLUSIONS: Delusional misidentification and hallucinations in the
	early stages of dementia may improve differentiation between patients
	with dementia with Lewy bodies and those with Alzheimer's disease
	and have important treatment implications.}},

	the human brain based on interregional correlations of blood oxygen
	level-dependent (BOLD) signal during natural viewing conditions.
	We propose that anatomical connections are reflected in BOLD signal
	correlations during natural brain dynamics. This may provide a powerful
	approach to chart connectivity, more so than that based on the 'resting
	state' of the human brain, and it may complement diffusion tensor
	imaging. Our approach relies on natural brain dynamics and is therefore
	experimentally unbiased and independent of hypothesis-driven, specialized
	stimuli. It has the advantage that natural viewing leads to considerably
	stronger cortical activity than rest, thus facilitating detection
	of weaker connections. To validate our technique, we used functional
	magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record BOLD signal while volunteers
	freely viewed a movie that was interrupted by resting periods. We
	used independent component analysis (ICA) to segregate cortical areas
	before characterizing the dynamics of their BOLD signal during free
	viewing and rest. Natural viewing and rest each revealed highly specific
	correlation maps, which reflected known anatomical connections. Examples
	are homologous regions in visual and auditory cortices in the two
	hemispheres and the language network consisting of Wernicke's area,
	Broca's area, and a premotor region. Correlations between regions
	known to be directly connected were always substantially higher than
	between nonconnected regions. Furthermore, compared to rest, natural
	viewing specifically increased correlations between anatomically
	connected regions while it decreased correlations between nonconnected
	regions. Our findings therefore demonstrate that natural viewing
	conditions lead to particularly specific interregional correlations
	and thus provide a powerful environment to reveal anatomical connectivity
	in vivo. }},

	properties during run time. With DCA we simultaneously calculate
	a two-dimensional projection of cluster centers (MDS) and data points

	artefacts present in the data in terms of their temporal, spatial,

	compared with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC; Harshman and Lundy,
	1984. In Research methods for multimode data analysis, chapter 5,

	in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plaques are found in the extracellular
	space of telencephalic structures, and have been shown to disrupt
	neuronal connectivity. Since the disruption of connectivity may underlie
	a number of the symptoms of AD, understanding the distribution of
	plaques in the neuropil in relation to the connectivity pattern of
	the neuronal network is crucial. We measured the distribution and
	clustering patterns of plaques in the vibrissae-receptive primary
	sensory cortex (barrel cortex), in which the cortical columnar structure
	is anatomically demarcated by boundaries in Layer IV. We found that
	the plaques are not distributed randomly with respect to the barrel
	structures in Layer IV; rather, they are more concentrated in the
	septal areas than in the barrels. This difference was not preserved
	in the supragranular extensions of the functional columns. When comparing
	the degree of clustering of plaques between primary sensory cortices,
	we found that the degree of plaques clustering is significantly higher
	in somatosensory cortex than in visual cortex, and these differences
	are preserved in Layers II/III. The degree of areal discontinuity
	is therefore correlated with the patterns of neuropathological deposits.
	The discontinuous anatomical structure of this area allows us to
	make predictions about the functional effects of plaques on specific
	patterns of computational disruption in the AD brain.}},

	Various measures of connectivity exist that allow one to quantify
	these functional interactions using functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (fMRI), which enables the non-invasive, yet indirect, measure
	of cerebral activity. I developed a series of methods that allows
	to characterize the reorganization of large-scale networks in the
	brain when considering an fMRI longitudinal study of a single subject
	or group of subjects, at various stages of a learning process. First,
	the regions of the network involved in the execution of the task
	under scrutiny are built and identified from the functional data
	in an exploratory way, by using a competitive region growing method,
	which segments the gray matter into functionally homogeneous regions,
	then followed by a statistical classification procedure. A statistical
	method is then designed to assess which interactions are significantly
	modulated within the network during the plasticity process. This
	method is based on a non-parametric bootstrap technique, taking the
	temporal auto-correlation of fMRI time series into account, and controling
	the false discovery rate. These methods have been validated and evaluated

	for Octave and Matlab (PSOM) is a flexible framework for the implementation
	of pipelines in the form of Octave or Matlab scripts. PSOM does not
	introduce new language constructs to specify the steps and structure
	of the workflow. All steps of analysis are instead described by a
	regular Matlab data structure, documenting their associated command
	and options, as well as their input, output, and cleaned-up files.
	The PSOM execution engine provides a number of automated services:
	(1) it executes jobs in parallel on a local computing facility as
	long as the dependencies between jobs allow for it and sufficient
	resources are available; (2) it generates a comprehensive record
	of the pipeline stages and the history of execution, which is detailed
	enough to fully reproduce the analysis; (3) if an analysis is started
	multiple times, it executes only the parts of the pipeline that need
	to be reprocessed. PSOM is distributed under an open-source MIT license
	and can be used without restriction for academic or commercial projects.
	The package has no external dependencies besides Matlab or Octave,
	is straightforward to install and supports of variety of operating
	systems (Linux, Windows, Mac). We ran several benchmark experiments
	on a public database including 200 subjects, using a pipeline for

	a multi-level fashion to investigate stable RSNs at the level of
	individual subjects and at the level of a group; (2) it provides
	a principled measure of RSN stability; and (3) the maximization of
	the stability measure can be used as a natural criterion to select
	the number of RSNs. A simulation study validated the good performance
	of the multi-level BASC on purely synthetic data. Stable networks
	were also derived from a real resting-state study for 43 subjects.
	At the group level, seven RSNs were identified which exhibited a
	good agreement with the previous findings from the literature. The
	comparison between the individual and group-level stability maps
	demonstrated the capacity of BASC to establish successful correspondences
	between these two levels of analysis and at the same time retain
	some interesting subject-specific characteristics, e.g. the specific
	involvement of subcortical regions in the visual and fronto-parietal
	networks for some subjects.}},

	Cross-sectional studies report prominent deficits of episodic memory

	Although semantic encoding is found to be impaired in conditions

	indicate the presence of a partial deficit of working memory with
	the ability to divide attention being most severely impaired. However,
	there appears to be heterogeneity as to the extent of the working
	memory impairment. The presence of vascular anomalies on MRI, as
	well as being in a more advanced stage in the continuum from MCI

	From the mutual information between the activities of the voxels

	space reflecting the dependency relations based on the distance matrix.

	out to be the resting-state networks. The decomposition is performed

  journal = {BMC bioinformatics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {9 Suppl 2},
  abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The unsupervised discovery of structures (i.e. clusterings)
	underlying data is a central issue in several branches of bioinformatics.
	Methods based on the concept of stability have been recently proposed
	to assess the reliability of a clustering procedure and to estimate
	the "optimal" number of clusters in bio-molecular data. A major problem
	with stability-based methods is the detection of multi-level structures
	(e.g. hierarchical functional classes of genes), and the assessment
	of their statistical significance. In this context, a chi-square
	based statistical test of hypothesis has been proposed; however,
	to assure the correctness of this technique some assumptions about
	the distribution of the data are needed. RESULTS: To assess the statistical
	significance and to discover multi-level structures in bio-molecular
	data, a new method based on Bernstein's inequality is proposed. This
	approach makes no assumptions about the distribution of the data,
	thus assuring a reliable application to a large range of bioinformatics
	problems. Results with synthetic and DNA microarray data show the
	effectiveness of the proposed method. CONCLUSIONS: The Bernstein
	test, due to its loose assumptions, is more sensitive than the chi-square
	test to the detection of multiple structures simultaneously present
	in the data. Nevertheless it is less selective, that is subject to
	more false positives, but adding independence assumptions, a more
	selective variant of the Bernstein inequality-based test is also
	presented. The proposed methods can be applied to discover multiple
	structures and to assess their significance in different types of

  abstract = {{A state-space modeling approach for examining dynamic relationship
	between multiple brain regions was proposed in Ho, Ombao and Shumway
	(Ho, M.R., Ombao, H., Shumway, R., 2005. A State-Space Approach to
	Modelling Brain Dynamics to Appear in Statistica Sinica). Their approach
	assumed that the quantity representing the influence of one neuronal
	system over another, or effective connectivity, is time-invariant.
	However, more and more empirical evidence suggests that the connectivity
	between brain areas may be dynamic which calls for temporal modeling
	of effective connectivity. A Bayesian approach is proposed to solve
	this problem in this paper. Our approach first decomposes the observed
	time series into measurement error and the BOLD (blood oxygenation
	level-dependent) signals. To capture the complexities of the dynamic
	processes in the brain, region-specific activations are subsequently
	modeled, as a linear function of the BOLD signals history at other
	brain regions. The coefficients in these linear functions represent
	effective connectivity between the regions under consideration. They
	are further assumed to follow a random walk process so to characterize
	the dynamic nature of brain connectivity. We also consider the temporal
	dependence that may be present in the measurement errors. ML-II method
	(Berger, J.O., 1985. Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis
	(2nd ed.). Springer, New York) was employed to estimate the hyperparameters
	in the model and Bayes factor was used to compare among competing
	models. Statistical inference of the effective connectivity coefficients
	was based on their posterior distributions and the corresponding
	Bayesian credible regions (Carlin, B.P., Louis, T.A., 2000. Bayes
	and Empirical Bayes Methods for Data Analysis (2nd ed.). Chapman
	and Hall, Boca Raton). The proposed method was applied to a functional
	magnetic resonance imaging data set and results support the theory
	of attentional control network and demonstrate that this network
	is dynamic in nature.}},

	investigate the impact of these low-frequency respiration variations
	on both task activation fMRI studies and resting-state functional
	connectivity analysis. Unlike MR signal changes correlated with the
	breathing motion ( approximately 0.3 Hz), BOLD signal changes correlated
	with across-breath variations in respiratory volume ( approximately
	0.03 Hz) appear localized to blood vessels and regions with high
	blood volume, such as gray matter, similar to changes seen in response
	to a breath-hold challenge. In addition, the respiration-variation-induced
	signal changes were found to coincide with many of the areas identified
	as part of the 'default mode' network, a set of brain regions hypothesized
	to be more active at rest. Regions could therefore be classified
	as being part of a resting network based on their similar respiration-induced
	changes rather than their synchronized neuronal activity. Monitoring
	and removing these respiration variations led to a significant improvement
	in the identification of task-related activation and deactivation
	and only slight differences in regions correlated with the posterior
	cingulate at rest. Regressing out global signal changes or cueing

	signal fluctuations induced by slower breath-to-breath changes in
	the depth and rate of breathing are typically not removed. These

	connectivity, and have been shown to significantly affect seed-ROI

	from independent component analysis (ICA) of resting-state data.
	Regions of the default mode network were identified by deactivations

	to separate the default mode network and the respiration-related

	identified as respiration-related. Furthermore, in most cases the

	We have recently demonstrated using functional magnetic resonance
	imaging the presence of synchronous low-frequency fluctuations of
	signal intensities from the resting human brain that have a high
	degree of temporal correlation (p<0.0001) both within and across
	the sensorimotor cortex. A statistically significant overlap between
	the resting-state functional connectivity map and the task-activation
	map due to bilateral finger tapping was obtained. Similar results
	have been obtained in the auditory and visual cortex. Because the
	pulse sequence used for collecting data was sensitive to blood flow
	and blood oxygenation, these low-frequency fluctuations of signal
	intensity may have arisen from variations of both. The objective
	of this study was simultaneously to determine the contribution of
	the blood oxygenation level signal and the flow signal to physiological
	fluctuations in the resting brain using the flow-sensitive alternating
	inversion recovery pulse sequence. In all subjects, the functional
	connectivity maps obtained from BOLD had a greater coincidence with
	task-activation maps than the corresponding functional connectivity
	maps obtained from blood-flow signals at the same level of statistical
	significance. Results of this study suggest that while variations
	in blood flow might contribute to functional connectivity maps, BOLD
	signals play a dominant role in the mechanism that gives rise to
	functional connectivity in the resting human brain. {\copyright}

  abstract = {{ Although it is being successfully implemented for exploration of
	the genome, discovery science has eluded the functional neuroimaging
	community. The core challenge remains the development of common paradigms
	for interrogating the myriad functional systems in the brain without
	the constraints of a priori hypotheses. Resting-state functional
	MRI (R-fMRI) constitutes a candidate approach capable of addressing
	this challenge. Imaging the brain during rest reveals large-amplitude
	spontaneous low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations in the fMRI signal
	that are temporally correlated across functionally related areas.
	Referred to as functional connectivity, these correlations yield
	detailed maps of complex neural systems, collectively constituting
	an individual's "functional connectome." Reproducibility across datasets
	and individuals suggests the functional connectome has a common architecture,
	yet each individual's functional connectome exhibits unique features,
	with stable, meaningful interindividual differences in connectivity
	patterns and strengths. Comprehensive mapping of the functional connectome,
	and its subsequent exploitation to discern genetic influences and
	brain-behavior relationships, will require multicenter collaborative
	datasets. Here we initiate this endeavor by gathering R-fMRI data
	from 1,414 volunteers collected independently at 35 international
	centers. We demonstrate a universal architecture of positive and
	negative functional connections, as well as consistent loci of inter-individual
	variability. Age and sex emerged as significant determinants. These
	results demonstrate that independent R-fMRI datasets can be aggregated
	and shared. High-throughput R-fMRI can provide quantitative phenotypes
	for molecular genetic studies and biomarkers of developmental and
	pathological processes in the brain. To initiate discovery science
	of brain function, the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project dataset
	is freely accessible at www.nitrc.org/projects/fcon\_1000/. }},

  abstract = {{This work addresses the choice of the imaging voxel volume in blood
	oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging
	(fMRI). Noise of physiological origin that is present in the voxel
	time course is a prohibitive factor in the detection of small activation-induced
	BOLD signal changes. If the physiological noise contribution dominates
	over the temporal fluctuation contribution in the imaging voxel,
	further increases in the voxel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) will have
	diminished corresponding increases in temporal signal-to-noise (TSNR),
	resulting in reduced corresponding increases in the ability to detect
	activation induced signal changes. On the other hand, if the thermal
	and system noise dominate (suggesting a relatively low SNR) further
	decreases in SNR can prohibit detection of activation-induced signal
	changes. Here we have proposed and called the "suggested" voxel volume
	for fMRI the volume where thermal plus system-related and physiological
	noise variances are equal. Based on this condition we have created
	maps of fMRI suggested voxel volume from our experimental data at
	3T, since this value will spatially vary depending on the contribution
	of physiologic noise in each voxel. Based on our fast EPI segmentation
	technique we have found that for gray matter (GM), white matter (WM),
	and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) brain compartments the mean suggested
	cubical voxel volume is: (1.8[no-break space]mm)3, (2.1[no-break
	space]mm)3 and (1.4[no-break space]mm)3, respectively. Serendipitously,
	(1.8[no-break space]mm)3 cubical voxel volume for GM approximately
	matches the cortical thickness, thus optimizing BOLD contrast by
	minimizing partial volume averaging. The introduced suggested fMRI
	voxel volume can be a useful parameter for choice of imaging volume

	have altered activation compared with age-matched healthy control
	(HC) subjects during a task that typically recruits the dorsal visual
	pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed in accordance
	with the Declaration of Helsinki, with institutional ethics committee
	approval, and all subjects provided written informed consent. Two
	tasks were performed to investigate neural function: face matching
	and location matching. Twelve patients with mild AD and 14 age-matched
	HC subjects were included. Brain activation was measured by using
	functional magnetic resonance imaging. Group statistical analyses
	were based on a mixed-effects model corrected for multiple comparisons.
	RESULTS: Task performance was not statistically different between
	the two groups, and within groups there were no differences in task
	performance. In the HC group, the visual perception tasks selectively
	activated the visual pathways. Conversely in the AD group, there
	was no selective activation during performance of these same tasks.
	Along the dorsal visual pathway, the AD group recruited additional
	regions, primarily in the parietal and frontal lobes, for the location-matching
	task. There were no differences in activation between groups during
	the face-matching task. CONCLUSION: The increased activation in the
	AD group may represent a compensatory mechanism for decreased processing
	effectiveness in early visual areas of patients with AD. The findings
	support the idea that the dorsal visual pathway is more susceptible

  abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: Cognitive reserve (CR) reflects the capacity of the
	brain to endure neuropathology in order to minimize clinical manifestations.
	Previous studies showed that CR modulates the patterns of brain activity
	in both healthy and clinical populations. In the present study we
	sought to determine whether reorganizations of functional brain resources
	linked to CR could already be observed in amnestic mild cognitive
	impairment (a-MCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients when
	performing a task corresponding to an unaffected cognitive domain.
	We further investigated if activity in regions showing task-induced
	deactivations, usually identified as pertaining to the default-mode
	network (DMN), was also influenced by CR. METHODS: Fifteen healthy
	elders, 15 a-MCI and 15 AD patients underwent functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI) during a speech comprehension task. Differences
	in the regression of slopes between CR proxies and blood-oxygen-level
	dependent (BOLD) signals across clinical groups were investigated
	for activation and deactivation areas. Correlations between significant
	fMRI results and a language comprehension test were also computed.
	RESULTS: Among a-MCI and AD we observed positive correlations between
	CR measures and BOLD signals in task-induced activation areas directly
	processing speech, as well as greater deactivations in regions of
	the DMN. These relationships were inverted in healthy elders. We
	found no evidence that these results were mediated by gray matter
	volumes. Increased activity in left frontal areas and decreased activity
	in the anterior cingulate were related to better language comprehension
	in clinical evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings provide
	evidence that the neurofunctional reorganizations related to CR among
	a-MCI and AD patients can be seen even when considering a preserved
	cognitive domain, being independent of gray matter atrophy. Areas
	showing both task-induced activations and deactivations are modulated
	by CR in an opposite manner when considering healthy elders versus
	patients. Brain reorganizations facilitated by CR may reflect behavioral
	compensatory mechanisms.}},

  abstract = {{Large-scale neural networks are thought to be an essential substrate
	for the implementation of cognitive function by the brain. If so,
	then a thorough understanding of cognition is not possible without
	knowledge of how the large-scale neural networks of cognition (neurocognitive
	networks) operate. Of necessity, such understanding requires insight
	into structural, functional, and dynamical aspects of network operation,
	the intimate interweaving of which may be responsible for the intricacies
	of cognition. Knowledge of anatomical structure is basic to understanding
	how neurocognitive networks operate. Phylogenetically and ontogenetically
	determined patterns of synaptic connectivity form a structural network
	of brain areas, allowing communication between widely distributed
	collections of areas. The function of neurocognitive networks depends
	on selective activation of anatomically linked cortical and subcortical
	areas in a wide variety of configurations. Large-scale functional
	networks provide the cooperative processing which gives expression
	to cognitive function. The dynamics of neurocognitive network function
	relates to the evolving patterns of interacting brain areas that
	express cognitive function in real time. This article considers the
	proposition that a basic similarity of the structural, functional,
	and dynamical features of all neurocognitive networks in the brain
	causes them to function according to common operational principles.
	The formation of neural context through the coordinated mutual constraint
	of multiple interacting cortical areas, is considered as a guiding
	principle underlying all cognitive functions. Increasing knowledge
	of the operational principles of neurocognitive networks is likely
	to promote the advancement of cognitive theories, and to seed strategies

	to test the relationship between the rapidly fluctuating EEG-defined
	microstates and the slowly oscillating fMRI-defined resting states,
	we recorded 64-channel EEG in the scanner while subjects were at
	rest with their eyes closed. Conventional EEG-microstate analysis
	determined the typical four EEG topographies that dominated across
	all subjects. The convolution of the time course of these maps with

	These networks were spatially correlated with four of the resting-state
	networks (RSNs) that were found by the conventional fMRI group-level
	independent component analysis (ICA). These RSNs have previously
	been attributed to phonological processing, visual imagery, attention
	reorientation, and subjective interoceptive--autonomic processing.
	We found no EEG-correlate of the default mode network. Thus, the

	In 2006, the worldwide prevalence of Alzheimer's disease was 26.6

	to that of a nursing home. If interventions could delay both disease
	onset and progression by a modest 1 year, there would be nearly 9.2
	million fewer cases of the disease in 2050, with nearly the entire
	decline attributable to decreases in persons needing a high level

	We investigated the functional relations of beta-synchronized neuronal

	By using power and coherence spectral analysis, we identified a beta-synchronized

	exerting Granger causal influences on motor cortex. Granger causal
	influences from motor cortex to postcentral sites, however, were

	the presence of an interconnected brain system. Providing insight

	reveals that it is best understood as multiple interacting subsystems.
	The medial temporal lobe subsystem provides information from prior
	experiences in the form of memories and associations that are the
	building blocks of mental simulation. The medial prefrontal subsystem
	facilitates the flexible use of this information during the construction
	of self-relevant mental simulations. These two subsystems converge

	distinct, functionally specialized systems. These nexuses are intriguing
	because of their potential role in integration and also because they
	may augment metabolic cascades relevant to brain disease. To identify
	regions of high connectivity in the human cerebral cortex, we applied
	a computationally efficient approach to map the degree of intrinsic
	functional connectivity across the brain. Analysis of two separate
	functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets (each n = 24) demonstrated
	hubs throughout heteromodal areas of association cortex. Prominent
	hubs were located within posterior cingulate, lateral temporal, lateral
	parietal, and medial/lateral prefrontal cortices. Network analysis
	revealed that many, but not all, hubs were located within regions
	previously implicated as components of the default network. A third
	dataset (n = 12) demonstrated that the locations of hubs were present
	across passive and active task states, suggesting that they reflect
	a stable property of cortical network architecture. To obtain an
	accurate reference map, data were combined across 127 participants
	to yield a consensus estimate of cortical hubs. Using this consensus
	estimate, we explored whether the topography of hubs could explain
	the pattern of vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease (AD) because
	some models suggest that regions of high activity and metabolism
	accelerate pathology. Positron emission tomography amyloid imaging
	in AD (n = 10) compared with older controls (n = 29) showed high
	amyloid-beta deposition in the locations of cortical hubs consistent
	with the possibility that hubs, while acting as critical way stations
	for information processing, may also augment the underlying pathological

	activity patterns that exist during passive task states. One observation
	is that a network of regions, referred to as the default network,

	as compared to a wide range of active tasks. The second observation
	is that distributed regions spontaneously increase and decrease their
	activity together within functional-anatomic networks, even under

	functions that consolidate the past, stabilize brain ensembles, and
	prepare us for the future. Accumulating data further suggest that

	conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and autism. Maps of spontaneous

  abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the problem of evaluating goodness-of-fit
	of a path analytic model to an interregional correlation matrix derived
	from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We argue
	that model evaluation based on testing the null hypothesis that the
	correlation matrix predicted by the model equals the population correlation
	matrix is problematic because P values are conditional on asymptotic
	distributional results (which may not be valid for fMRI data acquired
	in less than 10 min), as well as arbitrary specification of residual
	variances and effective degrees of freedom in each regional fMRI
	time series. We introduce an alternative approach based on an algorithm
	for automatic identification of the best fitting model that can be
	found to account for the data. The algorithm starts from the null
	model, in which all path coefficients are zero, and iteratively unconstrains
	the coefficient which has the largest Lagrangian multiplier at each
	step until a model is identified which has maximum goodness by a
	parsimonious fit index. Repeating this process after bootstrapping
	the data generates a confidence interval for goodness-of-fit of the
	best model. If the goodness of the theoretically preferred model
	is within this confidence interval we can empirically say that the
	theoretical model could be the best model. This relativistic and
	data-based strategy for model evaluation is illustrated by analysis
	of functional MR images acquired from 20 normal volunteers during
	periodic performance (for 5 min) of a task demanding semantic decision
	and subvocal rehearsal. A model including unidirectional connections
	from frontal to parietal cortex, designed to represent sequential
	engagement of rehearsal and monitoring components of the articulatory
	loop, is found to be irrefutable by hypothesis-testing and within
	confidence limits for the best model that could be fitted to the

	has disproportionate spectral power at low frequencies, i.e., its
	spectrum is (1/f)-like. Various pre-whitening and pre-coloring strategies
	have been proposed to make valid inference on standardised test statistics
	estimated by time series regression in this context of residually
	autocorrelated errors. Here we introduce a new method based on random
	permutation after orthogonal transformation of the observed time
	series to the wavelet domain. This scheme exploits the general whitening
	or decorrelating property of the discrete wavelet transform and is
	implemented using a Daubechies wavelet with four vanishing moments
	to ensure exchangeability of wavelet coefficients within each scale
	of decomposition. For (1/f)-like or fractal noises, e.g., realisations
	of fractional Brownian motion (fBm) parameterised by Hurst exponent
	0 < H < 1, this resampling algorithm exactly preserves wavelet-based
	estimates of the second order stochastic properties of the (possibly
	nonstationary) time series. Performance of the method is assessed
	empirically using (1/f)-like noise simulated by multiple physical
	relaxation processes, and experimental fMRI data. Nominal type 1
	error control in brain activation mapping is demonstrated by analysis
	of 13 images acquired under null or resting conditions. Compared
	to autoregressive pre-whitening methods for computational inference,
	a key advantage of wavelet resampling seems to be its robustness

  abstract = {{▪ Abstract  It has been clear for almost two decades that cortical
	representations in adult animals are not fixed entities, but rather,
	are dynamic and are continuously modified by experience. The cortex
	can preferentially allocate area to represent the particular peripheral
	input sources that are proportionally most used. Alterations in cortical
	representations appear to underlie learning tasks dependent on the
	use of the behaviorally important peripheral inputs that they represent.
	The rules governing this cortical representational plasticity following
	manipulations of inputs, including learning, are increasingly well
	understood. In parallel with developments in the field of cortical
	map plasticity, studies of synaptic plasticity have characterized
	specific elementary forms of plasticity, including associative long-term
	potentiation and long-term depression of excitatory postsynaptic
	potentials. Investigators have made many important strides toward
	understanding the molecular underpinnings of these fundamental plasticity
	processes and toward defining the learning rules that govern their
	induction. The fields of cortical synaptic plasticity and cortical
	map plasticity have been implicitly linked by the hypothesis that
	synaptic plasticity underlies cortical map reorganization. Recent
	experimental and theoretical work has provided increasingly stronger
	support for this hypothesis. The goal of the current paper is to
	review the fields of both synaptic and cortical map plasticity with
	an emphasis on the work that attempts to unite both fields. A second
	objective is to highlight the gaps in our understanding of synaptic
	and cellular mechanisms underlying cortical representational plasticity.}},

	be explained by CR effects. To this aim, brain activity, heartbeat,
	and respiration are measured during resting-state and while subjects
	perform a cognitive task with a high- and low-demand condition. To
	correct for CR effects we used RETROICOR (Glover et al., [2000]:

	CR effects were present within the frequency-range of the DMN and
	were located in areas of the DMN, but equally so in other areas.
	After removal of CR effects, deactivation and resting-state connectivity

	deactivation was still modulated by task demand. The same CR correction

  abstract = {{Nearly all neuroimaging data analysis rests upon some form of variance
	partitioning. Conventional analyses, with a general linear model
	(GLM), partition the variance in the measured response variable into
	partitions described by a design matrix of explanatory variables.
	This approach can also be adopted in the initial modeling of the
	data in studies using data-led methods to summarize functional connectivity,
	such as principle component analysis, or studies of effective connectivity,
	using for example structural equation modeling. The point made in
	this technical note is that the partition of the original time series
	has to be precisely described to qualify the sources of variations
	that are taken into account. For conventional analyses using the
	GLM, the partition investigated corresponds to the subspaces of the
	design matrix that are tested. However, in the analyses of functional
	and effective connectivity, the particular subspaces considered are
	not always specified explicitly. Here we show that selecting different
	subspaces, or variance partitions, can have a profound effect, both
	qualitatively and quantitatively, on the sample covariances and the
	ensuing inferences about connectivity. We will illustrate this using
	simulated data that include condition and block-related effects and
	their interactions. We will use these three subspaces to show how
	the correlation between two voxels depends on which sub-partitions
	are examined. We will also show how the partition of the design matrix
	influences the resulting correlation matrix observed when studying
	correlations between error terms. We will finally demonstrate, quantitatively,
	the effect of the variance partitions considered on the correlations
	between two regions using a real fMRI study of biological motion.}},

  abstract = {{Independent component analysis (ICA) is a data-driven approach utilizing
	high-order statistical moments to find maximally independent sources
	that has found fruitful application in functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (fMRI). Being a blind source separation technique, ICA does
	not require any explicit constraints upon the fMRI time courses.
	However, for some fMRI data analysis applications, such as for the
	analysis of an event-related paradigm, it would be useful to flexibly
	incorporate paradigm information into the ICA analysis. In this paper,
	we present an approach for constrained or semi-blind ICA (sbICA)
	analysis of event-related fMRI data by imposing regularization on
	certain estimated time courses using the paradigm information. We
	demonstrate the performance of our approach using both simulations
	and fMRI data from a three-stimulus auditory oddball paradigm. Simulation
	results suggest that (1) a regression approach slightly outperforms
	ICA when prior information is accurate and ICA outperforms the general
	linear model (GLM)-based approach when prior information is not completely
	accurate, (2) prior information improves the robustness of ICA in
	the presence of noise, and (3) ICA analysis using prior information
	with temporal constraints can outperform a regression approach when
	the prior information is not completely accurate. Using fMRI data,
	we compare a regression-based conjunction analysis of target and
	novel stimuli, both of which elicit an orienting response, to an
	sbICA approach utilizing both the target and novel stimuli to constrain
	the ICA time courses. Results show similar positive associations
	for both GLM and sbICA, but sbICA detects additional negative associates
	consistent with regions implicated in a default mode of brain activity.
	This suggests that task-related default mode decreases have a more
	'' complex'' signal that benefits from a flexible modeling approach.
	Compared with a traditional GLM approach, the sbICA approach provides
	a flexible way to analyze fMRI data that reduces the assumptions
	placed upon the hemodynamic response of the brain. The advantages
	and limitations of our technique are discussed in detail in the manuscript
	to provide guidelines to the reader for developing useful applications.
	The use of prior time course information in a spatial ICA analysis,
	which combines elements of both a regression approach and a blind
	ICA approach, may prove to be a useful tool for fMRI analysis.}},

  abstract = {{ Independent component analysis (ICA) has become an increasingly
	utilized approach for analyzing brain imaging data. In contrast to
	the widely used general linear model (GLM) that requires the user
	to parameterize the data (e.g. the brain's response to stimuli),
	ICA, by relying upon a general assumption of independence, allows
	the user to be agnostic regarding the exact form of the response.
	In addition, ICA is intrinsically a multivariate approach, and hence
	each component provides a grouping of brain activity into regions
	that share the same response pattern thus providing a natural measure
	of functional connectivity. There are a wide variety of ICA approaches
	that have been proposed, in this paper we focus upon two distinct
	methods. The first part of this paper reviews the use of ICA for
	making group inferences from fMRI data. We provide an overview of
	current approaches for utilizing ICA to make group inferences with
	a focus upon the group ICA approach implemented in the GIFT software.
	In the next part of this paper, we provide an overview of the use
	of ICA to combine or fuse multimodal data. ICA has proven particularly
	useful for data fusion of multiple tasks or data modalities such
	as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data or event-related potentials.
	As demonstrated by a number of examples in this paper, ICA is a powerful
	and versatile data-driven approach for studying the brain. }},

  abstract = {The effect of regressing out the global average signal (GAS) in resting
	state fMRI data has become a concern for interpreting functional
	connectivity analyses. It is not clear whether the reported anti-correlations
	between the Default Mode and the Dorsal Attention Networks are intrinsic
	to the brain, or are artificially created by regressing out the GAS.
	Here we introduce a concept, Impact of the Global Average on Functional
	Connectivity (IGAFC), for quantifying the sensitivity of seed-based
	correlation analyses to the regression of the GAS. This voxel-wise
	IGAFC index is defined as the product of two correlation coefficients:
	the correlation between the GAS and the fMRI time course of a voxel,
	times the correlation between the GAS and the seed time course. This
	definition enables the calculation of a threshold at which the impact
	of regressing-out the GAS would be large enough to introduce spurious
	negative correlations. It also yields a post-hoc impact correction
	procedure via thresholding, which eliminates spurious correlations
	introduced by regressing out the GAS. In addition, we introduce an
	Artificial Negative Correlation Index (ANCI), defined as the absolute
	difference between the IGAFC index and the impact threshold. The
	ANCI allows a graded confidence scale for ranking voxels according
	to their likelihood of showing artificial correlations. By applying
	this method, we observed regions in the Default Mode and Dorsal Attention
	Networks that were anti-correlated. These findings confirm that the
	previously reported negative correlations between the Dorsal Attention
	and Default Mode Networks are intrinsic to the brain and not the
	result of statistical manipulations. Our proposed quantification
	of the impact that a confound may have on functional connectivity
	can be generalized to global effect estimators other than the GAS.
	It can be readily applied to other confounds, such as systemic physiological
	or head movement interferences, in order to quantify their impact
	on functional connectivity in the resting state.},

	that his descriptions of the ego are consistent with the functions
	of the default-mode and its reciprocal exchanges with subordinate
	brain systems. This neurobiological account rests on a view of the
	brain as a hierarchical inference or Helmholtz machine. In this view,
	large-scale intrinsic networks occupy supraordinate levels of hierarchical
	brain systems that try to optimize their representation of the sensorium.
	This optimization has been formulated as minimizing a free-energy;
	a process that is formally similar to the treatment of energy in
	Freudian formulations. We substantiate this synthesis by showing
	that Freud's descriptions of the primary process are consistent with
	the phenomenology and neurophysiology of rapid eye movement sleep,
	the early and acute psychotic state, the aura of temporal lobe epilepsy
	and hallucinogenic drug states. }},

	imaging (fMRI) activity in 52 individuals across the continuum of
	normal aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild AD. Independent
	component analyses revealed specific memory-related networks that
	activated or deactivated during an associative memory paradigm. Across
	all subjects, hippocampal activation and parietal deactivation demonstrated
	a strong reciprocal relationship. Furthermore, we found evidence
	of a nonlinear trajectory of fMRI activation across the continuum
	of impairment. Less impaired MCI subjects showed paradoxical hyperactivation
	in the hippocampus compared with controls, whereas more impaired
	MCI subjects demonstrated significant hypoactivation, similar to
	the levels observed in the mild AD subjects. We found a remarkably
	parallel curve in the pattern of memory-related deactivation in medial
	and lateral parietal regions with greater deactivation in less-impaired
	MCI and loss of deactivation in more impaired MCI and mild AD subjects.
	Interestingly, the failure of deactivation in these regions was also
	associated with increased positive activity in a neocortical attentional
	network in MCI and AD. Our findings suggest that loss of functional
	integrity of the hippocampal-based memory systems is directly related
	to alterations of neural activity in parietal regions seen over the

  abstract = {{The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is crucially involved in the executive
	component of working memory, representation of task state, and behavior
	selection. This article presents a large-scale computational model
	of the PFC and associated brain regions designed to investigate the
	mechanisms by which working memory and task state interact to select
	adaptive behaviors from a behavioral repertoire. The model consists
	of multiple brain regions containing neuronal populations with realistic
	physiological and anatomical properties, including extrastriate visual
	cortical regions, the inferotemporal cortex, the PFC, the striatum,
	and midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons. The onset of a delayed match-to-sample
	or delayed nonmatch-to-sample task triggers tonic DA release in the
	PFC causing a switch into a persistent, stimulus-insensitive dynamic
	state that promotes the maintenance of stimulus representations within
	prefrontal networks. Other modeled prefrontal and striatal units
	select cognitive acceptance or rejection behaviors according to which
	task is active and whether prefrontal working memory representations
	match the current stimulus. Working memory task performance and memory
	fields of prefrontal delay units are degraded by extreme elevation
	or depletion of tonic DA levels. Analyses of cellular and synaptic
	activity suggest that hyponormal DA levels result in increased prefrontal
	activation, whereas hypernormal DA levels lead to decreased activation.
	Our simulation results suggest a range of predictions for behavioral,
	single-cell, and neuroimaging response data under the proposed task
	set and under manipulations of DA concentration.}},

	present study, we investigated the dynamic behavior of resting-state
	connectivity across the course of a single scan, performing a time--frequency

	the connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a primary

	coherence and phase between the PCC and the anticorrelated network
	was variable in time and frequency, and statistical testing based
	on Monte Carlo simulations revealed the presence of significant scale-dependent
	temporal variability. In addition, a sliding-window correlation procedure
	identified other regions across the brain that exhibited variable
	connectivity with the PCC across the scan, which included areas previously

  abstract = {{Previous studies have reported that the spontaneous, resting-state
	time course of the default-mode network is negatively correlated
	with that of the '' task-positive network'', a collection of regions
	commonly recruited in demanding cognitive tasks. However, all studies
	of negative correlations between the default-mode and task-positive
	networks have employed some form of normalization or regression of
	the whole-brain average signal ( '' global signal''); these processing
	steps alter the time series of voxels in an uninterpretable manner
	as well as introduce spurious negative correlations. Thus, the extent
	of negative correlations with the default mode network without global
	signal removal has not been well characterized, and it is has recently
	been hypothesized that the apparent negative correlations in many
	of the task-positive regions could be artifactually induced by global
	signal pre-processing. The present study aimed to examine negative
	and positive correlations with the default-mode network when model-based
	corrections for respiratory and cardiac noise are applied in lieu
	of global signal removal. Physiological noise correction consisted
	of (1) removal of time-locked cardiac and respiratory artifacts using
	RETROICOR (Glover, G.H., Li, T.Q., Ress, D., 2000. Image-based method
	for retrospective correction of physiological motion effects in fMRI:
	RETROICOR. Magn. Reson. Med. 44, 162--167), and (2) removal of low-frequency
	respiratory and heart rate variations by convolving these waveforms
	with pre-determined transfer functions (Birn et al., 2008; Chang
	et al., 2009) and projecting the resulting two signals out of the
	data. It is demonstrated that negative correlations between the default-mode
	network and regions of the task-positive network are present in the
	majority of individual subjects both with and without physiological
	noise correction. Physiological noise correction increased the spatial
	extent and magnitude of negative correlations, yielding negative
	correlations within task-positive regions at the group-level (p <
	0.05, uncorrected; no regions at the group level were significant
	at FDR = 0.05). Furthermore, physiological noise correction caused
	region-specific decreases in positive correlations within the default-mode
	network, reducing apparent false positives. It was observed that
	the low-frequency respiratory volume and cardiac rate regressors
	used within the physiological noise correction algorithm displayed
	significant (but not total) shared variance with the global signal,
	and constitute a model-based alternative to correcting for non-neural
	global noise.}},

	assessed using joint peristimulus time histograms and, in particular,
	the mutual information between stimulus-induced transients in two

	Furthermore, as the background activity increases, the populations
	become increasingly sensitive to the intensity of the stimulus in

	an interaction between background activity and stimulus intensity
	in producing dynamic correlations, in that background activity augments
	stimulus-induced coherence modulation. This is interesting from a
	computational perspective because background activity establishes
	a context that may have a profound effect on event-related interactions

	total firing rates, which subsume both background activity and stimulus-related
	rate modulation, were almost linearly related to the expression of

	show that under the assumptions implicit in our model, rate-specific

	the same issue using stimulus-evoked transients.) By manipulation
	parameters such as extrinsic input, intrinsic noise, synaptic efficacy,
	density of extrinsic connections, the voltage-sensitive nature of
	postsynaptic mechanisms, the number of neurons, and the laminar structure
	within the populations, we were able to introduce variations in both
	mean activity and synchronization under a variety of simulated neuronal
	architectures. Analyses of the simulated spike trains and local field
	potentials showed that in nearly every domain of the model's parameter
	space, mean activity and synchronization were tightly coupled. This
	coupling appears to be mediated by an increase in synchronous gain
	when effective membrane time constants are lowered by increased activity.
	These observations show that under the assumptions implicit in our
	models, rate coding and synchrony coding in neural systems with reciprocal
	interconnections are two perspectives on the same underlying dynamic.
	This suggests that in the absence of specific mechanisms decoupling
	changes in synchronization from firing levels, indexes of brain activity
	that are based purely on synaptic activity (e.g., functional magnetic
	resonance imaging) may also be sensitive to changes in synchronous
	coupling.}},

	days. The experiment consists of four conditions, one audio condition

	analyzed using multiple linear regression and the results were further
	used to generate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for
	each condition for each individual subject. By using area under the
	curve as a comparison index, we found that stroke patients have less
	reliability across time than healthy participants, and that when
	the participants gesture during speech, their imaging data are more
	reliable than when they are performing hand movements that are not

	states, rather than emphasizing the standard spatial mapping. Based
	on the block datasets of Functional Imaging Analysis Contest (FIAC)
	Subject 3, we demonstrate the potential and pitfalls of predictive
	modeling in fMRI analysis by investigating the performance of five
	models (linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, linear
	support vector machine, Gaussian naive Bayes, and a variant) as a
	function of preprocessing steps and feature selection methods. We
	found that: (1) independent of the model, temporal detrending and
	feature selection assisted in building a more accurate predictive
	model; (2) the linear support vector machine and logistic regression
	often performed better than either of the Gaussian naive Bayes models
	in terms of the optimal prediction accuracy; and (3) the optimal
	prediction accuracy obtained in a feature space using principal components
	was typically lower than that obtained in a voxel space, given the
	same model and same preprocessing. We show that due to the existence
	of artifacts from different sources, high prediction accuracy alone
	does not guarantee that a classifier is learning a pattern of brain
	activity that might be usefully visualized, although cross-validation
	methods do provide fairly unbiased estimates of true prediction accuracy.
	The trade-off between the prediction accuracy and the reproducibility
	of the spatial pattern should be carefully considered in predictive
	modeling of fMRI. We suggest that unless the experimental goal is

	called SmartPhantom has been developed to simulate functional blood

	radio frequency coil, comprising two perpendicular planar loops that

	fMRI data sets are acquired with the SmartPhantom. One with high

	decrease in volume from CTRL to AD. Mean diffusivity (MD) values
	increased progressively across the three groups in the bilateral

	The results show that the effects of acoustic noise on motor and

	the corresponding (visual) cortical activity is diminished substantially
	when the subject is exposed to a loud acoustic sound. Although the

  abstract = {{ Although mind wandering occupies a large proportion of our waking
	life, its neural basis and relation to ongoing behavior remain controversial.
	We report an fMRI study that used experience sampling to provide
	an online measure of mind wandering during a concurrent task. Analyses
	focused on the interval of time immediately preceding experience
	sampling probes demonstrate activation of default network regions
	during mind wandering, a finding consistent with theoretical accounts
	of default network functions. Activation in medial prefrontal default
	network regions was observed both in association with subjective
	self-reports of mind wandering and an independent behavioral measure
	(performance errors on the concurrent task). In addition to default
	network activation, mind wandering was associated with executive
	network recruitment, a finding predicted by behavioral theories of
	off-task thought and its relation to executive resources. Finally,
	neural recruitment in both default and executive network regions
	was strongest when subjects were unaware of their own mind wandering,
	suggesting that mind wandering is most pronounced when it lacks meta-awareness.
	The observed parallel recruitment of executive and default network
	regions--two brain systems that so far have been assumed to work
	in opposition--suggests that mind wandering may evoke a unique mental
	state that may allow otherwise opposing networks to work in cooperation.
	The ability of this study to reveal a number of crucial aspects of
	the neural recruitment associated with mind wandering underscores
	the value of combining subjective self-reports with online measures
	of brain function for advancing our understanding of the neurophenomenology
	of subjective experience. }},

  abstract = {{There are growing numbers of studies using machine learning approaches
	to characterize patterns of anatomical difference discernible from
	neuroimaging data. The high-dimensionality of image data often raises
	a concern that feature selection is needed to obtain optimal accuracy.
	Among previous studies, mostly using fixed sample sizes, some show
	greater predictive accuracies with feature selection, whereas others
	do not. In this study, we compared four common feature selection
	methods. 1) Pre-selected region of interests (ROIs) that are based
	on prior knowledge. 2) Univariate t-test filtering. 3) Recursive
	feature elimination (RFE), and 4) t-test filtering constrained by
	ROIs. The predictive accuracies achieved from different sample sizes,
	with and without feature selection, were compared statistically.
	To demonstrate the effect, we used grey matter segmented from the
	T1-weighted anatomical scans collected by the Alzheimer's disease
	Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) as the input features to a linear
	support vector machine classifier. The objective was to characterize
	the patterns of difference between Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients
	and cognitively normal subjects, and also to characterize the difference
	between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and normal subjects.
	In addition, we also compared the classification accuracies between
	MCI patients who converted to AD and MCI patients who did not convert
	within the period of 12 months. Predictive accuracies from two data-driven
	feature selection methods (t-test filtering and RFE) were no better
	than those achieved using whole brain data. We showed that we could
	achieve the most accurate characterizations by using prior knowledge
	of where to expect neurodegeneration (hippocampus and parahippocampal
	gyrus). Therefore, feature selection does improve the classification
	accuracies, but it depends on the method adopted. In general, larger
	sample sizes yielded higher accuracies with less advantage obtained
	by using knowledge from the existing literature.}},

	tensor imaging in evaluating microstructural changes in the spectrum
	of cognitive decline from ageing to Alzheimer's disease, in particular
	focusing on mild cognitive impairment. RECENT FINDINGS: Mild cognitive
	impairment represents a transition phase between normal ageing and
	early Alzheimer's disease. Diffusion tensor imaging has emerged as
	a useful imaging modality that provides information about the structural
	integrity of tissue. In healthy ageing, diffusion tensor imaging
	abnormalities occur in the frontal regions, specifically the frontal
	white matter, anterior cingulum and the genu of the corpus callosum.
	Some studies report an anterior-posterior gradient change with greater
	abnormalities in the genu than the splenium of the corpus callosum
	and in the frontal than parietal white matter. In Alzheimer's disease,
	diffusion tensor imaging abnormalities are concentrated in the posterior
	regions: the parahippocampal gyrus, temporal white matter, splenium
	of corpus callosum and posterior cingulum. In mild cognitive impairment,
	changes seem to parallel those in Alzheimer's disease, with similar
	posterior regions showing abnormalities. SUMMARY: Due to the similarities
	in diffusion tensor imaging findings in both mild cognitive impairment
	and Alzheimer's disease, it is likely that diffusion tensor imaging
	has the potential to emerge as a useful clinical tool for early detection
	and monitoring of disease progression and treatment response in mild
	cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease patients.}},

	high-dimensional fMRI data, we must also regularize to improve model
	stability, and the interactions between classifier and regularization
	techniques are still being investigated. Classifiers are usually
	compared on large, multisubject fMRI datasets. However, it is unclear
	how classifier/regularizer models perform for within-subject analyses,
	as a function of signal strength and sample size. We compare four
	standard classifiers: Linear and Quadratic Discriminants, Logistic
	Regression and Support Vector Machines. Classification was performed
	on data in the linear kernel (covariance) feature space, and classifiers
	are tuned with four commonly-used regularizers: Principal Component
	and Independent Component Analysis, and penalization of kernel features
	using L1 and L2 norms. We evaluated prediction accuracy (P) and spatial
	reproducibility (R) of all classifier/regularizer combinations on
	single-subject analyses, over a range of three different block task
	contrasts and sample sizes for a BOLD fMRI experiment. We show that
	the classifier model has a small impact on signal detection, compared
	to the choice of regularizer. PCA maximizes reproducibility and global
	SNR, whereas Lp-norms tend to maximize prediction. ICA produces low
	reproducibility, and prediction accuracy is classifier-dependent.
	However, trade-offs in (P,R) depend partly on the optimization criterion,
	and PCA-based models are able to explore the widest range of (P,R)

	little consensus on the optimal choice of data preprocessing steps
	to minimize these effects. To evaluate the effects of various preprocessing
	strategies, we present a framework which comprises a combination
	of (1) nonparametric testing including reproducibility and prediction
	metrics of the data-driven NPAIRS framework (Strother et al. [2002]:
	NeuroImage 15:747-771), and (2) intersubject comparison of SPM effects,

	of brain activation maps may be significantly limited by sub-optimal
	choices of data preprocessing steps (or "pipeline") in a clinical
	task-design, an fMRI adaptation of the widely used Trail-Making Test.
	The relative importance of motion correction, physiological noise
	correction, motion parameter regression, and temporal detrending
	were examined for fMRI data acquired in young, healthy adults. Analysis
	performance and the quality of activation maps were evaluated based
	on Penalized Discriminant Analysis (PDA). The relative importance

	Friedman rank test for fixed sets of preprocessing steps, applied

	for each subject. Results demonstrate that preprocessing choices
	have significant, but subject-dependant effects, and that individually-optimized
	pipelines may significantly improve the reproducibility of fMRI results
	over fixed pipelines. This was demonstrated by the detection of a
	significant interaction with motion parameter regression and physiological
	noise correction, even though the range of subject head motion was
	small across the group (≪ 1 voxel). Optimizing pipelines on an individual-subject

	between disease severity and performance on brain activation associated
	with episodic memory encoding and retrieval in persons with mild
	cognitive impairment (MCI). METHOD: This was achieved by scanning
	12 MCI persons and 10 age- and education-matched healthy controls
	while encoding words and while retrieving them in a recognition test.
	RESULTS: Behaviorally, there was no significant group difference
	on recognition performance. However, MCI and healthy controls showed
	different patterns of cerebral activation during encoding. While
	most of these differences demonstrated reduced activation in the
	MCI group, there were areas of increased activation in the left ventrolateral
	prefrontal cortex. Reduced activation was found in brain areas known
	to be either structurally compromised or hypometabolic in Alzheimer's
	disease (AD). In contrast, very few group differences were associated
	with retrieval. Correlation analyses indicated that increased disease
	severity, as measured with the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, was
	associated with smaller activation of the right middle and superior
	temporal gyri. In contrast, recognition success in MCI persons was
	associated with larger activation of the left ventrolateral prefrontal
	cortex during the encoding phase. CONCLUSION: Overall, our results
	indicate that most of the memory-related cerebral network changes
	in MCI persons occur during the encoding phase. They also suggest
	that a prefrontal compensatory mechanism could occur in parallel
	with the disease-associated reduction of cerebral activation in temporal
	areas.}},

	use of in vivo diffusion imaging and white matter tractography as
	a non-invasive method for the structural and functional parcellation
	of the human cerebral cortex, discussing the strengths and limitations
	of the current approaches. Cortical parcellation via white matter
	connectivity is based on the premise that, as connectional anatomy
	determines functional organization, it should be possible to segregate
	functionally-distinct cortical regions by identifying similarities
	and differences in connectivity profiles. Recent studies have provided
	initial evidence in support of the efficacy of this connectional
	parcellation methodology. Such investigations have identified distinct
	cortical subregions which correlate strongly with functional regions
	identified via fMRI and meta-analyses. Furthermore, a strong parallel
	between the cortical regions defined via tractographic and more traditional
	cytoarchitectonic parcellation methods has been observed. However,
	the degree of correspondence and relative functional importance of
	cytoarchitectonic- versus connectivity-derived parcellations still
	remains unclear. Diffusion tractography remains one of the only methods
	capable of visualizing the structural networks of the brain in vivo.

	in restricted domains, (e.g., topographically-organized sensory regions),

	enhance the quality of many experimental analyses allowing more accurate

	promising as a way to accurately localize differences in patterns

	we applied a novel set of image analysis tools to explore the utility
	of rs-fcMRI for defining wide-ranging functional area boundaries.
	We find that rs-fcMRI patterns show sharp transitions in correlation
	patterns and that these putative areal boundaries can be reliably

	combining surface-based analysis techniques with image processing
	algorithms allows automated mapping of putative areal boundaries
	across large expanses of cortex without the need for prior information

	task ("resting state"), time courses of voxels within functionally
	connected regions of the brain have high cross-correlation coefficients
	("functional connectivity"). The purpose of this study was to measure
	the contributions of low frequencies and physiological noise to cross-correlation
	maps. METHODS: In four healthy volunteers, task-activation functional
	MR imaging and resting-state data were acquired. We obtained four
	contiguous slice locations in the "resting state" with a high sampling
	rate. Regions of interest consisting of four contiguous voxels were
	selected. The correlation coefficient for the averaged time course
	and every other voxel in the four slices was calculated and separated
	into its component frequency contributions. We calculated the relative
	amounts of the spectrum that were in the low-frequency (0 to 0.1
	Hz), the respiratory-frequency (0.1 to 0.5 Hz), and cardiac-frequency
	range (0.6 to 1.2 Hz). RESULTS: For each volunteer, resting-state
	maps that resembled task-activation maps were obtained. For the auditory
	and visual cortices, the correlation coefficient depended almost
	exclusively on low frequencies (<0.1 Hz). For all cortical regions
	studied, low-frequency fluctuations contributed more than 90\% of
	the correlation coefficient. Physiological (respiratory and cardiac)
	noise sources contributed less than 10\% to any functional connectivity
	MR imaging map. In blood vessels and cerebrospinal fluid, physiological
	noise contributed more to the correlation coefficient. CONCLUSION:
	Functional connectivity in the auditory, visual, and sensorimotor
	cortices is characterized predominantly by frequencies slower than
	those in the cardiac and respiratory cycles. In functionally connected
	regions, these low frequencies are characterized by a high degree
	of temporal coherence.}},

  abstract = {{Independent component analysis (ICA) is a popular blind source separation
	technique that has proven to be promising for the analysis of functional
	magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. A number of ICA approaches
	have been used for fMRI data analysis, and even more ICA algorithms
	exist; however, the impact of using different algorithms on the results
	is largely unexplored. In this paper, we study the performance of
	four major classes of algorithms for spatial ICA, namely, information
	maximization, maximization of non-Gaussianity, joint diagonalization
	of cross-cumulant matrices and second-order correlation-based methods,
	when they are applied to fMRI data from subjects performing a visuo-motor
	task. We use a group ICA method to study variability among different
	ICA algorithms, and we propose several analysis techniques to evaluate
	their performance. We compare how different ICA algorithms estimate
	activations in expected neuronal areas. The results demonstrate that
	the ICA algorithms using higher-order statistical information prove
	to be quite consistent for fMRI data analysis. Infomax, FastICA and
	joint approximate diagonalization of eigenmatrices (JADE) all yield
	reliable results, with each having its strengths in specific areas.
	Eigenvalue decomposition (EVD), an algorithm using second-order statistics,
	does not perform reliably for fMRI data. Additionally, for iterative
	ICA algorithms, it is important to investigate the variability of
	estimates from different runs. We test the consistency of the iterative
	algorithms Infomax and FastICA by running the algorithm a number
	of times with different initializations, and we note that they yield
	consistent results over these multiple runs. Our results greatly
	improve our confidence in the consistency of ICA for fMRI data analysis.

  abstract = {{Connectivity analyses and computational modeling of human brain function
	from fMRI data frequently require the specification of regions of
	interests (ROIs). Several analyses have relied on atlases derived
	from anatomical or cyto-architectonic boundaries to specify these
	ROIs, yet the suitability of atlases for resting state functional
	connectivity (FC) studies has yet to be established. This article
	introduces a data-driven method for generating an ROI atlas by parcellating
	whole brain resting-state fMRI data into spatially coherent regions
	of homogeneous FC. Several clustering statistics are used to compare
	methodological trade-offs as well as determine an adequate number
	of clusters. Additionally, we evaluate the suitability of the parcellation
	atlas against four ROI atlases (Talairach and Tournoux, Harvard-Oxford,
	Eickoff-Zilles, and Automatic Anatomical Labeling) and a random parcellation
	approach. The evaluated anatomical atlases exhibit poor ROI homogeneity
	and do not accurately reproduce FC patterns present at the voxel
	scale. In general, the proposed functional and random parcellations
	perform equivalently for most of the metrics evaluated. ROI size
	and hence the number of ROIs in a parcellation had the greatest impact
	on their suitability for FC analysis. With 200 or fewer ROIs, the
	resulting parcellations consist of ROIs with anatomic homology, and
	thus offer increased interpretability. Parcellation results containing
	higher numbers of ROIs (600 or 1,000) most accurately represent FC
	patterns present at the voxel scale and are preferable when interpretability
	can be sacrificed for accuracy. The resulting atlases and clustering
	software have been made publicly available at: http://www.nitrc.org/projects/cluster\_roi/.

  abstract = {{Recently, several high dimensional classification methods have been
	proposed to automatically discriminate between patients with Alzheimer's
	disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and elderly controls
	(CN) based on T1-weighted MRI. However, these methods were assessed
	on different populations, making it difficult to compare their performance.
	In this paper, we evaluated the performance of ten approaches (five
	voxel-based methods, three methods based on cortical thickness and
	two methods based on the hippocampus) using 509 subjects from the
	ADNI database. Three classification experiments were performed: CN
	vs AD, CN vs MCIc (MCI who had converted to AD within 18months, MCI
	converters - MCIc) and MCIc vs MCInc (MCI who had not converted to
	AD within 18months, MCI non-converters - MCInc). Data from 81 CN,
	67 MCInc, 39 MCIc and 69 AD were used for training and hyperparameters
	optimization. The remaining independent samples of 81 CN, 67 MCInc,
	37 MCIc and 68 AD were used to obtain an unbiased estimate of the
	performance of the methods. For AD vs CN, whole-brain methods (voxel-based
	or cortical thickness-based) achieved high accuracies (up to 81\%
	sensitivity and 95\% specificity). For the detection of prodromal
	AD (CN vs MCIc), the sensitivity was substantially lower. For the
	prediction of conversion, no classifier obtained significantly better
	results than chance. We also compared the results obtained using
	the DARTEL registration to that using SPM5 unified segmentation.
	DARTEL significantly improved six out of 20 classification experiments
	and led to lower results in only two cases. Overall, the use of feature
	selection did not improve the performance but substantially increased
	the computation times.}},

	magnetic resonance imaging data and voxel-based graph-theory analysis
	to systematically investigate intrinsic functional connectivity patterns
	of whole-brain networks in 32 AD patients and 38 healthy controls
	(HCs). We found that AD selectively targeted highly connected hub
	regions (in terms of nodal functional connectivity strength) of brain
	networks, involving the medial and lateral prefrontal and parietal
	cortices, insula, and thalamus. This impairment was connectivity
	distance-dependent (Euclidean), with the most prominent disruptions

	AD also disrupted functional connections within the default-mode,
	salience and executive-control modules, and connections between the
	salience and executive-control modules. These disruptions of hub
	connectivity and modular integrity significantly correlated with

	Suffering from Focal Epilepsy: An Initial Step toward Individual

  journal = {Frontiers in Neuroscience},
  year = {2014},
  volume = {8},

  abstract = {The spatial coherence of spontaneous slow fluctuations in the blood-oxygen-level
	dependent (BOLD) signal at rest is routinely used to characterize
	the underlying resting-state networks (RSNs). Studies have demonstrated
	that these patterns are organized in space and highly reproducible
	from subject to subject. Moreover, RSNs reorganizations have been
	suggested in pathological conditions. Comparisons of RSNs organization
	have been performed between groups of subjects but have rarely been
	applied at the individual level, a step required for clinical application.
	Defining the notion of modularity as the organization of brain activity
	in stable networks, we propose DANI - Detection of Abnormal Networks
	in Individuals - to identify modularity changes at the individual
	level. The stability of each RSN was estimated using a spatial clustering
	method: BASC Bootstrap Analysis of Stable Clusters (Bellec et al
	Neuroimage,51(3),2010). Our contributions consisted in (i) providing
	functional maps of the most stable cores of each networks and (ii)
	in detecting “abnormal” individual changes in networks organization
	when compared to a population of healthy controls. DANI was first
	evaluated using realistic simulated data, showing that focussing
	on a conservative core size (50% most stable regions) improved the
	sensitivity to detect modularity changes. DANI was then applied to

	cortex (MPFC) in response to fear perception. In this study we tested
	the hypothesis that schizophrenia is characterized by abnormal functional

	MRI images were acquired from 14 schizophrenia patients and 14 matched
	healthy control subjects during an emotion perception task, in which
	fearful and neutral facial expression stimuli were presented pseudorandomly
	under nonconscious (using masking) and conscious conditions. Both

	using a region of interest approach.ResultsIn response to fearful
	facial expressions, schizophrenia patients displayed reduced amygdala
	activity, compared to controls, in both the conscious and nonconscious
	conditions. The amygdala displayed a reversal of the normal pattern
	of connectivity with the brainstem, visual cortex, and also with
	the dorsal and ventral divisions of the MPFC in the schizophrenia
	patients.ConclusionsThe presence of functional disconnections in

	of the main aims in human genetics. In the context of complex diseases,

	to develop general yet sensitive methods for gene mapping. We discuss
	the use of Shannon's information theory for population-based gene

	Various measures of mutual information were employed in order to
	develop a comprehensive framework for gene mapping analyses. An algorithm
	aimed at finding so-called relevance chains of causal markers is
	proposed. Moreover, entropy measures are used in conjunction with
	multidimensional scaling to visualize clusters of genetic markers.
	The relevance chain algorithm successfully detected the two causal
	regions in a simulated scenario. The approach has also been applied
	to a published clinical study on autoimmune (Graves') disease. Results
	were consistent with those of standard statistical methods, but identified
	an additional locus of interest in the promoter region of the associated

	of Alzheimer's disease, but this has not been investigated in relation
	to neuroimaging findings OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the distribution
	of blood pressure and an indicator of atherosclerosis (pulse pressure)
	in patients with Alzheimer's disease with and without small vessel
	disease. METHODS: 152 Alzheimer patients underwent 1.0T MRI scanning.
	Blood pressure was measured with a sphygmomanometer. Small vessel
	disease was assessed by the presence of lacunar infarcts and white
	matter lesions. The distribution of blood pressure and pulse pressure,
	with or without small vessel disease, was assessed by linear regression
	analysis. RESULTS: Patients with small vessel disease had a higher
	blood pressure, a wider pulse pressure, and an increased prevalence
	of hypertension. These findings were strongly age dependent: for
	patients under 65, mean systolic blood pressure was higher in the
	subpopulation with small vessel disease than in those without (mean
	(SD): 149.9 (19.3) v 135.7 (20.5) mm Hg; p = 0.02). Hypertension
	was more common in patients with white matter lesions than in those
	without (75.6\% v 45.1\%; p = 0.03) and the pulse pressure was higher
	(61.9 (14.4) v 51.7 (11.5) mm Hg; p = 0.01). There was no relation
	between blood pressure and the degree of (sub)cortical and hippocampal
	atrophy in patients without small vessel disease. CONCLUSIONS: There
	was heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease patients with respect to
	blood pressure and pulse pressure. Alzheimer's disease encompasses
	a heterogeneous group of disorders which share a common cognitive
	profile but with distinct radiological features with respect to white
	matter lesions.}},

  abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of the human
	brain have suggested that low-frequency fluctuations in resting fMRI
	data collected using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast
	correspond to functionally relevant resting state networks (RSNs).
	Whether the fluctuations of resting fMRI signal in RSNs are a direct
	consequence of neocortical neuronal activity or are low-frequency
	artifacts due to other physiological processes (e.g., autonomically
	driven fluctuations in cerebral blood flow) is uncertain. In order
	to investigate further these fluctuations, we have characterized
	their spatial and temporal properties using probabilistic independent
	component analysis (PICA), a robust approach to RSN identification.
	Here, we provide evidence that: i. RSNs are not caused by signal
	artifacts due to low sampling rate (aliasing); ii. they are localized
	primarily to the cerebral cortex; iii. similar RSNs also can be identified
	in perfusion fMRI data; and iv. at least 5 distinct RSN patterns
	are reproducible across different subjects. The RSNs appear to reflect
	'' default'' interactions related to functional networks related
	to those recruited by specific types of cognitive processes. RSNs
	are a major source of non-modeled signal in BOLD fMRI data, so a
	full understanding of their dynamics will improve the interpretation
	of functional brain imaging studies more generally. Because RSNs
	reflect interactions in cognitively relevant functional networks,
	they offer a new approach to the characterization of state changes
	with pathology and the effects of drugs.}},

  abstract = {{The quality of MRI time series data, which allows the study of dynamic
	processes, is often affected by confounding sources of signal fluctuation,
	including the cardiac and respiratory cycle. An adaptive filter is
	described, reducing these signal fluctuations as long as they are
	repetitive and their timing is known. The filter, applied in image
	domain, does not require temporal oversampling of the artifact-related
	fluctuations. Performance is demonstrated for suppression of cardiac
	and respiratory artifacts in 10-minute brain scans on 6 normal volunteers.
	Experimental parameters resemble a typical fMRI experiment (17 slices;
	1700[no-break space]ms TR). A second dataset was acquired at a rate
	well above the Nyquist frequency for both cardiac and respiratory
	cycle (single slice; 100[no-break space]ms TR), allowing identification
	of artifacts specific to the cardiac and respiratory cycles, aiding
	assessment of filtering performance. Results show significant reduction
	in temporal standard deviation (SDt) in all subjects. For all 6 datasets
	with 1700[no-break space]ms TR combined, the filtering method resulted
	in an average reduction in SDt of 9.2\% in 2046 voxels substantially
	affected by respiratory artifacts, and 12.5\% for the 864 voxels
	containing substantial cardiac artifacts. The maximal SDt reduction
	achieved was 52.7\% for respiratory and 55.3\% for cardiac filtering.
	Performance was found to be at least equivalent to the previously
	published RETROICOR method. Furthermore, the interaction between
	the filter and fMRI activity detection was investigated using Monte
	Carlo simulations, demonstrating that filtering algorithms introduce
	a systematic error in the detected BOLD-related signal change if
	applied sequentially. It is demonstrated that this can be overcome
	by combining physiological artifact filtering and detection of BOLD-related
	signal changes simultaneously. Visual fMRI data from 6 volunteers
	were analyzed with and without the filter proposed here. Inclusion
	of the cardio-respiratory regressors in the design matrix yielded
	a 4.6\% t-score increase and 4.0\% increase in the number of significantly
	activated voxels.}},

	auditory mental imagery (AUDI); somatosensory awareness (SOMA); inner
	musical experience (MUSI); and mental manipulation of numbers (NUMB).
	For IMAG and LANG, additional questions estimated association of
	such activities with ongoing learning, retrospective memories, or
	prospective thoughts. Using a 0-100\% scale, the participant quantitatively
	rated the proportion of time spent in each mental activity during
	the resting state fMRI acquisition. A total of 180 healthy volunteers
	completed the ReSQ immediately after being scanned with fMRI while
	at rest. Of these, 66\% exhibited dominance of a type of mental activity
	at rest (IMAG: 35\%; LANG: 17\%; SOMA: 7\%; MUSI: 6\%; NUMB: 1\%).
	A majority of participants reported either retrospective memories

  abstract = {{We present the results from two sets of Monte Carlo simulations aimed

	SPM99 for the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
	Statistical robustness was estimated by implementing parametric and
	nonparametric simulation approaches based on the images obtained
	from an event-related fMRI experiment. Simulated datasets were tested
	for combinations of the following parameters: basis function, global
	scaling, low-pass filter, high-pass filter and autoregressive modeling
	of serial autocorrelation. Based on single-subject SPM analysis,
	we derived the following conclusions that may serve as a guide for
	initial analysis of fMRI data using SPM99: (1) The canonical hemodynamic
	response function is a more reliable basis function to model the
	fMRI time series than HRF with time derivative. (2) Global scaling
	should be avoided since it may significantly decrease the power depending
	on the experimental design. (3) The use of a high-pass filter may
	be beneficial for event-related designs with fixed interstimulus
	intervals. (4) When dealing with fMRI time series with short interstimulus
	intervals (<8 s), the use of first-order autoregressive model is
	recommended over a low-pass filter (HRF) because it reduces the risk
	of inferential bias while providing a relatively good power. For
	datasets with interstimulus intervals longer than 8 seconds, temporal
	smoothing is not recommended since it decreases power. While the
	generalizability of our results may be limited, the methods we employed
	can be easily implemented by other scientists to determine the best
	parameter combination to analyze their data.}},

	was used to measure changes in brain activity as subjects tracked
	a target under the influence of a rotational transformation that

	of two scanning sessions (obtained on days 2 and 7), aimed at examining
	early and late stages of learning. On average, visuomotor adaptation
	was achieved within 3 days. During early stages of adaptation, better
	performance was associated with greater activity in brain areas related
	to attention including bilateral dorso- and ventrolateral prefrontal
	cortices, frontal eye fields, and the human homologue of area MT.
	However, as adaptation proceeded, improvements in performance were
	associated with greater activity in motor regions such as the left
	(contralateral) sensorimotor cortex, bilateral anterior cerebellum,
	left cingulate motor area, right putamen, and a nonmotor region within
	the middle temporal gyrus. This learning-specific shift in brain
	activity was associated with a progressive change in the functional
	connectivity of these regions toward the end of the first session.
	Interestingly, only the functional connections between the anterior
	cerebellum, left middle temporal gyrus, and left sensorimotor cortex
	remained strong once visuomotor adaptation was achieved. Our findings
	suggest that visuomotor adaptation is not only reflected in persistent
	changes in activity in motor-related regions, but also in the strengthening

	as voxel intensities, derived from functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (fMRI) data, as inputs to efficient classifiers such as support
	vector machines (SVM) and is based on the spatial localization model
	of brain function. With the advent of the connectionist model of
	brain function, features from brain networks may provide increased
	discriminatory power for brain state classification. In this study,
	we introduce a novel framework where in both functional connectivity
	(FC) based on instantaneous temporal correlation and effective connectivity
	(EC) based on causal influence in brain networks are used as features
	in an SVM classifier. In order to derive those features, we adopt
	a novel approach recently introduced by us called correlation-purged
	Granger causality (CPGC) in order to obtain both FC and EC from fMRI
	data simultaneously without the instantaneous correlation contaminating
	Granger causality. In addition, statistical learning is accelerated
	and performance accuracy is enhanced by combining recursive cluster
	elimination (RCE) algorithm with the SVM classifier. We demonstrate
	the efficacy of the CPGC-based RCE-SVM approach using a specific
	instance of brain state classification exemplified by disease state
	prediction. Accordingly, we show that this approach is capable of
	predicting with 90.3\% accuracy whether any given human subject was
	prenatally exposed to cocaine or not, even when no significant behavioral
	differences were found between exposed and healthy subjects. The
	framework adopted in this work is quite general in nature with prenatal
	cocaine exposure being only an illustrative example of the power
	of this approach. In any brain state classification approach using
	neuroimaging data, including the directional connectivity information
	may prove to be a performance enhancer. When brain state classification
	is used for disease state prediction, our approach may aid the clinicians
	in performing more accurate diagnosis of diseases in situations where
	in non-neuroimaging biomarkers may be unable to perform differential

	functionally connected with medial portions of orbitofrontal cortex,

  abstract = {{The corpus callosum (CC), which connects the two cerebral hemispheres,
	is the largest white matter fiber bundle in the human brain. This
	structure presents a peculiar myelination pattern: it has small diameter
	fibers, located in the genu, which myelinate much later in normal
	development, and large diameter fibers of the splenium, which myelinate
	early in development. Although the pathology of AD mainly involves
	the cerebral gray matter structure, there is evidence that white
	matter may also be involved. To illustrate callosal white matter
	changes in AD pathology, in this review we summarize in vivo imaging
	studies in humans, focusing on region of interest, voxel-based morphometry,
	diffusion-weighted imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging techniques.
	Our aims were to identify where in the CC, when in the different
	stages of AD, and how callosal changes can be detected with different
	MRI techniques. Results showed that changes in the anterior (genu
	and anterior body) as well as in the posterior (isthmus and splenum)
	portions of the CC might already be present in the early stages of
	AD. These findings support the hypothesis that two mechanisms, Wallerian
	degeneration and myelin breakdown, might be responsible for the region-specific
	changes detected in AD patients. Wallerian degeneration affects the
	posterior CC subregion, which receives axons directly from those
	brain areas (temporo-parietal lobe regions) primarily affected by
	the AD pathology. Instead, the myelin breakdown process affects the
	later-myelinating CC subregion and explains the earlier involvement
	of the genu in CC atrophy.}},

	and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have begun to reveal abnormalities in
	large-scale memory and cognitive brain networks. Since the medial
	temporal lobe (MTL) memory system is a site of very early pathology
	in AD, a number of studies have focused on this region of the brain.
	Yet it is clear that other regions of the large-scale episodic memory
	network are affected early in the disease as well, and fMRI has begun
	to illuminate functional abnormalities in frontal, temporal, and
	parietal cortices as well in MCI and AD. Besides predictable hypoactivation
	of brain regions as they accrue pathology and undergo atrophy, there
	are also areas of hyperactivation in brain memory and cognitive circuits,
	possibly representing attempted compensatory activity. Recent fMRI
	data in MCI and AD are beginning to reveal relationships between
	abnormalities of functional activity in the MTL memory system and
	in functionally connected brain regions, such as the precuneus. Additional
	work with "resting state" fMRI data is illuminating functional-anatomic
	brain circuits and their disruption by disease. As this work continues
	to mature, it will likely contribute to our understanding of fundamental
	memory processes in the human brain and how these are perturbed in
	memory disorders. We hope these insights will translate into the

	Only workflow instructions and references to data, executable scripts
	and binary instructions are stored within the LONI Pipeline environment.
	This makes it portable, computationally efficient, distributed and
	independent of the individual binary processes involved in pipeline
	data-analysis workflows. We have expanded the LONI Pipeline (V.4.2)
	to include server-to-server (peer-to-peer) communication and a 3-tier
	failover infrastructure (Grid hardware, Sun Grid Engine/Distributed
	Resource Management Application API middleware, and the Pipeline

	variation of brain functional connectivity networks with respect
	to experimental conditions in fMRI data. It is related to the psychophysiological
	interaction technique introduced by Friston . and extends to networks
	of correlation modulation (CM networks). Extended networks containing
	several dozens of nodes are determined in which the links correspond
	to consistent correlation modulation across subjects. In addition,
	we assess inter-subject variability and determine networks in which
	the condition-dependent functional interactions can be explained
	by a subject-dependent variable. We applied the technique to data
	from a study on syntactical production in bilinguals and analysed
	functional interactions differentially across tasks (word reading
	or sentence production) and across languages. We find an extended
	network of consistent functional interaction modulation across tasks,
	whereas the network comparing languages shows fewer links. Interestingly,
	there is evidence for a specific network in which the differences
	in functional interaction across subjects can be explained by differences
	in the subjects' syntactical proficiency. Specifically, we find that
	regions, including ones that have previously been shown to be involved
	in syntax and in language production, such as the left inferior frontal
	gyrus, putamen, insula, precentral gyrus, as well as the supplementary
	motor area, are more functionally linked during sentence production
	in the second, compared with the first, language in syntactically
	more proficient bilinguals than in syntactically less proficient
	ones. Our approach extends conventional activation analyses to the
	notion of networks, emphasizing functional interactions between regions
	independently of whether or not they are activated. On the one hand,
	it gives rise to testable hypotheses and allows an interpretation
	of the results in terms of the previous literature, and on the other
	hand, it provides a basis for studying the structure of functional
	interactions as a whole, and hence represents a further step towards
	the notion of large-scale networks in functional imaging.}},

	dorsal anterior cingulate/medial superior frontal cortex, anterior

	efficiently in real-time. Towards this goal, we compared accuracy
	of six different ML algorithms applied to neuroimaging data of persons
	engaged in a bivariate task, asserting their belief or disbelief
	of a variety of propositional statements. We performed unsupervised
	dimension reduction and automated feature extraction using independent
	component (IC) analysis and extracted IC time courses. Optimization
	of classification hyperparameters across each classifier occurred
	prior to assessment. Maximum accuracy was achieved at 92\% for Random
	Forest, followed by 91\% for AdaBoost, 89\% for Na\"{i}ve Bayes,
	87\% for a J48 decision tree, 86\% for K*, and 84\% for support vector
	machine. For real-time decoding applications, finding a parsimonious
	subset of diagnostic ICs might be useful. We used a forward search
	technique to sequentially add ranked ICs to the feature subspace.
	For the current data set, we determined that approximately six ICs
	represented a meaningful basis set for classification. We then projected
	these six IC spatial maps forward onto a later scanning session within
	subject. We then applied the optimized ML algorithms to these new
	data instances, and found that classification accuracy results were
	reproducible. Additionally, we compared our classification method
	to our previously published general linear model results on this

  abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is a noninvasive method
	of imaging brain function in vivo. However, images produced in FMRI
	experiments are imperfect and contain several artifacts that contaminate
	the data. These artifacts include rigid-body motion effects, B0-field
	inhomogeneities, chemical shift, and eddy currents. To investigate
	these artifacts, with the eventual aim of minimizing or removing
	them completely, a computational model of the FMR image acquisition
	process was built that can simulate all of the above-mentioned artifacts.
	This paper gives an overview of the development of the FMRI simulator.
	The simulator uses the Bloch equations together with a geometric
	definition of the object (brain) and a varying T2* model for the
	BOLD activations. Furthermore, it simulates rigid-body motion of
	the object by solving Bloch equations for given motion parameters
	that are defined for an object moving continuously in time, including
	during the read-out period, which is a novel approach in the area
	of MRI computer simulations. With this approach it is possible, in
	a controlled and precise way, to simulate the full effects of various
	rigid-body motion artifacts in FMRI data (e.g. spin-history effects,
	B0-motion interaction, and within-scan motion blurring) and therefore
	formulate and test algorithms for their reduction. Magn Reson Med,

	of perfusion between FTD and Alzheimer disease (AD); and to determine
	whether hypoperfusion in FTD correlates with cognitive impairment.
	Methods: We included 21 patients with FTD, 24 patients with AD, and
	25 CN subjects in this cross-sectional MRI study. All subjects had
	MRI scans including T1-weighted structural images and ASL-MR images.
	Results: ASL-MRI detected a pattern of hypoperfusion in right frontal
	regions in patients with FTD vs CN subjects, similar to PET and SPECT.
	FTD had higher perfusion than AD in the parietal regions and posterior
	cingulate. Frontal hypoperfusion in FTD correlated with deficits
	in judgment and problem solving. Adding frontal perfusion to gray
	matter (GM) atrophy significantly improved the classification of
	FTD from normal aging to 74\%, and adding parietal perfusion to GM
	atrophy significantly improved the classification of FTD from AD

  title = {{Complex spatio-temporal dynamics of fMRI BOLD: A study of motor
	learning}},
  journal = {NeuroImage},
  volume = {In Press, Corrected Proof},
  abstract = {{Many studies have investigated the temporal properties of BOLD signal
	responses to task performance in regions of interest, often noting
	significant departures from the conventionally modelled response
	shape, and significant variation between regions. However, these
	investigations are rarely extended across the whole brain nor incorporated
	into the routine analysis of fMRI studies. As a result, little is
	known about the range of response shapes generated in the brain by
	common paradigms. The present study finds such temporal dynamics
	can be complex. We made a detailed investigation of BOLD signal responses
	across the whole brain during a two minute motor-sequence task, and
	tracked changes due to learning. The multi-component OSORU (Onset,
	Sustained, Offset, Ramp, Undershoot) linear model, developed by Harms
	and Melcher (J.Neurophysiology, 2003), was extended to characterise
	responses. In many regions, signal transients persisted for over
	thirty seconds, with large signal spikes at onset often followed
	by a dip in signal below the final sustained level of activation.
	Training altered certain features of the response shape, suggesting
	that different features of the response may reflect different aspects
	of neuro-vascular dynamics. Unmodelled, this may give rise to inconsistent
	results across paradigms of varying task durations. Few of the observed
	effects have been thoroughly addressed in physiological models of
	the BOLD response. The complex, extended dynamics generated by this
	simple, often employed task, suggests characterisation and modelling
	of temporal aspects of BOLD responses needs to be carried out routinely,
	informing experimental design and analysis, and physiological modelling.}},

  abstract = {{Neuroimaging technologies produce large and complex datasets. The
	challenge of comprehensively analysing the recorded dynamics remains
	an important field of research. The whole-brain linear modelling
	of hypothesised response dynamics and experimental effects must utilise
	simple basis sets, which may not detect unexpected or complex signal
	effects. These unmodelled effects can influence statistical mapping
	results, and provide important additional clues to the underlying
	neural dynamics. They can be detected via exploration of the raw
	signal, however this can be difficult. Specialised visualisation
	tools are required to manage the huge number of voxels, events and
	scans. Many effects can be occluded by noise in individual voxel
	time-series. This paper describes a visualisation framework developed
	for the assessment of entire neuroimaging datasets.While currently
	available tools tend to be tied to a specific model of experimental
	effects, this framework includes a novel metadata schema that enables
	the rapid selection and processing of responses based on easily-adjusted
	classifications of scans, brain regions, and events. Flexible event-related
	averaging and process pipelining capabilities enable users to investigate
	the effects of preprocessing algorithms and to visualise power spectra
	and other transformations of the data. The framework has been implemented
	as a MATLAB package, REX (Response Exploration), which has been utilised
	within our lab and is now publicly available for download. Its interface
	enables the real-time control of data selection and processing, for
	very rapid visualisation. The concepts outlined in this paper have
	general applicability, and could provide significant further functionality
	to neuroimaging databasing and process pipeline environments.}},

	to model-based General Linear Model (GLM)-type functional activation
	mapping. Functional homogeneity of the functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (fMRI) time series within and between clusters was examined
	on several levels of the visual network, starting from the level
	of individual clusters up to the network level comprising two or
	more distinct visual regions. On each level, the number of significant
	components was identified and compared with the number of clusters
	in the data set. Eigenimages were used to examine the regional distribution
	of the extracted components. It was shown that voxels within individual
	clusters and voxels located in bilateral homologue visual regions
	can be represented by a single component, constituting the characteristic
	functional specialization of the cluster(s). If, however, PCA was
	applied to time series of voxels located in functionally distinct

	being dominated by voxels in one of the investigated regions. The

	Felsenstein [Felsenstein, J. (1985) Evolution 39, 783-791] suggested
	the use of the bootstrap to answer this question. Felsenstein's method,
	which in concept is a straightforward application of the bootstrap,
	is widely used, but has been criticized as biased in the genetics
	literature. This paper concerns the use of the bootstrap in the tree

	it can be corrected to better agree with standard ideas of confidence
	levels and hypothesis testing. These corrections can be made by using
	the more elaborate bootstrap method presented here, at the expense

	estimating subject-specific time courses (TCs) and spatial maps (SMs)

	of four multi-subject ICA approaches in combination with data reduction

	TCs and SMs. Second, aggregate independent components are estimated
	using either noise-free ICA or probabilistic ICA (PICA). Third, subject-specific
	SMs and TCs are estimated using back-reconstruction. We compare several
	direct group ICA (GICA) back-reconstruction approaches (GICA1-GICA3)

	connectivity in nineteen healthy volunteers. Based on the known spatial

	We confirmed that the relative extent of the anterior and posterior

	We conclude that the working-memory function is related to a spatial

	'' stand-alone'' function or system. Regardless of the task, independent
	component analysis (ICA) produces a picture of the '' default-mode''
	function even when the subject is performing a simple sensori-motor
	task or just resting in the scanner. This has boosted the use of
	default-mode fMRI for non-invasive research in brain disorders. Here,
	we studied the effect of cognitive load modulation of fMRI responses
	on the ICA-based pictures of the default-mode function. In a standard
	graded working memory study based on the n-back task, we used group-level
	ICA to explore the variability of the default-mode network related
	to the engagement in the task, in 10 healthy volunteers. The analysis
	of the default-mode components highlighted similarities and differences
	in the layout under three different cognitive loads. We found a load-related
	general increase of deactivation in the cortical network. Nonetheless,
	a variable recruitment of the cingulate regions was evident, with
	greater extension of the anterior and lesser extension of the posterior
	clusters when switching from lower to higher working memory loads.
	A co-activation of the hippocampus was only found under no working
	memory load. As a generalization of our results, the variability
	of the default-mode pattern may link the default-mode system as a
	whole to cognition and may more directly support use of the ICA model
	for evaluating cognitive decline in brain disorders.}},

	to decompose functional MRI (fMRI) time-series into sets of activation
	maps and associated time-courses. Several ICA algorithms have been

	algorithms might lead to different spatial or temporal readouts of

	used so far for spatial ICA (sICA) of fMRI time-series: the Infomax
	(Bell and Sejnowski [1995]: Neural Comput 7:1004-1034) and the Fixed-Point
	(Hyv\"{a}rinen [1999]: Adv Neural Inf Proc Syst 10:273-279) algorithms.
	We evaluated the Infomax- and Fixed Point-based sICA decompositions
	of simulated motor, and real motor and visual activation fMRI time-series
	using an ensemble of measures. Log-likelihood (McKeown et al. [1998]:
	Hum Brain Mapp 6:160-188) was used as a measure of how significantly
	the estimated independent sources fit the statistical structure of
	the data; receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and linear correlation
	analyses were used to evaluate the algorithms' accuracy of estimating
	the spatial layout and the temporal dynamics of simulated and real
	activations; cluster sizing calculations and an estimation of a residual
	gaussian noise term within the components were used to examine the
	anatomic structure of ICA components and for the assessment of noise
	reduction capabilities. Whereas both algorithms produced highly accurate
	results, the Fixed-Point outperformed the Infomax in terms of spatial
	and temporal accuracy as long as inferential statistics were employed
	as benchmarks. Conversely, the Infomax sICA was superior in terms
	of global estimation of the ICA model and noise reduction capabilities.
	Because of its adaptive nature, the Infomax approach appears to be
	better suited to investigate activation phenomena that are not predictable

	functions. Studies of development often attempt to identify the organizing
	principles that guide the maturation of these functional networks.
	In this report, we combine resting state functional connectivity
	MRI (rs-fcMRI), graph analysis, community detection, and spring-embedding
	visualization techniques to analyze four separate networks defined
	in earlier studies. As we have previously reported, we find, across
	development, a trend toward 'segregation' (a general decrease in
	correlation strength) between regions close in anatomical space and
	'integration' (an increased correlation strength) between selected
	regions distant in space. The generalization of these earlier trends
	across multiple networks suggests that this is a general developmental
	principle for changes in functional connectivity that would extend
	to large-scale graph theoretic analyses of large-scale brain networks.
	Communities in children are predominantly arranged by anatomical
	proximity, while communities in adults predominantly reflect functional
	relationships, as defined from adult fMRI studies. In sum, over development,
	the organization of multiple functional networks shifts from a local
	anatomical emphasis in children to a more "distributed" architecture
	in young adults. We argue that this "local to distributed" developmental
	characterization has important implications for understanding the
	development of neural systems underlying cognition. Further, graph
	metrics (e.g., clustering coefficients and average path lengths)
	are similar in child and adult graphs, with both showing "small-world"-like
	properties, while community detection by modularity optimization
	reveals stable communities within the graphs that are clearly different
	between young children and young adults. These observations suggest
	that early school age children and adults both have relatively efficient
	systems that may solve similar information processing problems in
	divergent ways.}},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been growing enthusiasm that functional
	magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could achieve clinical utility for
	a broad range of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, several barriers
	remain. For example, the acquisition of large-scale datasets capable
	of clarifying the marked heterogeneity that exists in psychiatric
	illnesses will need to be realized. In addition, there continues
	to be a need for the development of image processing and analysis
	methods capable of separating signal from artifact. As a prototypical
	hyperkinetic disorder, and movement-related artifact being a significant
	confound in functional imaging studies, ADHD offers a unique challenge.
	As part of the ADHD-200 Global Competition and this special edition
	of Frontiers, the ADHD-200 Consortium demonstrates the utility of
	an aggregate dataset pooled across five institutions in addressing
	these challenges. The work aimed to (1) examine the impact of emerging
	techniques for controlling for "micro-movements," and (2) provide
	novel insights into the neural correlates of ADHD subtypes. Using
	support vector machine (SVM)-based multivariate pattern analysis
	(MVPA) we show that functional connectivity patterns in individuals
	are capable of differentiating the two most prominent ADHD subtypes.
	The application of graph-theory revealed that the Combined (ADHD-C)
	and Inattentive (ADHD-I) subtypes demonstrated some overlapping (particularly
	sensorimotor systems), but unique patterns of atypical connectivity.
	For ADHD-C, atypical connectivity was prominent in midline default
	network components, as well as insular cortex; in contrast, the ADHD-I
	group exhibited atypical patterns within the dlPFC regions and cerebellum.
	Systematic motion-related artifact was noted, and highlighted the
	need for stringent motion correction. Findings reported were robust
	to the specific motion correction strategy employed. These data suggest
	that resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) data can
	be used to characterize individual patients with ADHD and to identify
	neural distinctions underlying the clinical heterogeneity of ADHD.},

	useful tool for studying regional relationships in typical and atypical
	populations. Because many investigators have already obtained large
	data sets of task-related fMRI, the ability to use this existing
	task data for resting state fcMRI is of considerable interest. Two
	classes of data sets could potentially be modified to emulate resting
	state data. These data sets include: (1) "interleaved" resting blocks
	from blocked or mixed blocked/event-related sets, and (2) residual
	timecourses from event-related sets that lack rest blocks. Using
	correlation analysis, we compared the functional connectivity of
	resting epochs taken from a mixed blocked/event-related design fMRI
	data set and the residuals derived from event-related data with standard
	continuous resting state data to determine which class of data can
	best emulate resting state data. We show that, despite some differences,
	the functional connectivity for the interleaved resting periods taken
	from blocked designs is both qualitatively and quantitatively very
	similar to that of "continuous" resting state data. In contrast,
	despite being qualitatively similar to "continuous" resting state
	data, residuals derived from event-related design data had several
	distinct quantitative differences. These results suggest that the
	interleaved resting state data such as those taken from blocked or
	mixed blocked/event-related fMRI designs are well-suited for resting
	state functional connectivity analyses. Although using event-related
	data residuals for resting state functional connectivity may still
	be useful, results should be interpreted with care. }},

	a large reduction in EPI whole brain scan time at 3 and 7 Tesla,
	without significantly sacrificing spatial resolution, and while gaining
	functional sensitivity. The multiplexed-EPI (M-EPI) pulse sequence
	combines two forms of multiplexing: temporal multiplexing (m) utilizing
	simultaneous echo refocused (SIR) EPI and spatial multiplexing (n)
	with multibanded RF pulses (MB) to achieve m×n images in an EPI echo
	train instead of the normal single image. This resulted in an unprecedented
	reduction in EPI scan time for whole brain fMRI performed at 3 Tesla,
	permitting TRs of 400 ms and 800 ms compared to a more conventional
	2.5 sec TR, and 2-4 times reductions in scan time for HARDI imaging
	of neuronal fibertracks. The simultaneous SE refocusing of SIR imaging
	at 7 Tesla advantageously reduced SAR by using fewer RF refocusing
	pulses and by shifting fat signal out of the image plane so that
	fat suppression pulses were not required. In preliminary studies

	component analysis, the 6-fold higher sampling rate increased the
	peak functional sensitivity by 60\%. The novel M-EPI pulse sequence
	resulted in a significantly increased temporal resolution for whole

	preparation, thalamocortical synaptic responses exhibit N-methyl-D-aspartate

	during the critical period many thalamocortical synapses exhibit
	NMDA receptor currents but no detectable AMPA receptor currents,
	and thus may be functionally silent at resting membrane potentials.
	LTP converts silent synapses to functional ones by causing the rapid
	appearance of AMPA currents. These observations suggest that thalamocortical

  abstract = {{Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) describes a state of cognitive functioning
	that is below defined norms, yet falls short of dementia in severity.
	It exists across a cognitive continuum with borders that are difficult

	prevalence increases with age. A number of subtypes of MCI, including
	age-associated memory impairment (AAMI), age-associated cognitive
	decline (AACD), amnestic MCI (MCIa), and cognitive impairment not
	dementia (CIND) have contributed to our understanding of MCI. Recent
	efforts have been directed at developing a uniform diagnostic classification
	for MCI that reflects the maturation of knowledge about this state.
	There is considerable etiological and clinical heterogeneity within
	MCI; however, there is a unifying increased risk of progression to
	dementia. The diagnostic process for MCI involves assessment of multiple
	cognitive domains, with particular attention to episodic and semantic
	memory, while neuroimaging with structural MRI and PET both add to
	the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of MCI. Although there are
	no pharmacological treatments at present that are capable of delaying
	the long-term progression of MCI to dementia, there is some evidence
	of short-term symptomatic benefits with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
	MCI is an important clinical problem, which clinicians can expect
	to face with increasing frequency. The essentials of management include
	a thorough assessment directed at etiological determination and counseling

  abstract = {{There have been many interpretations of functional connectivity and
	proposed measures of temporal correlations between BOLD signals across
	different brain areas. These interpretations yield from many studies
	on functional connectivity using resting-state fMRI data that have
	emerged in recent years. However, not all of these studies used the
	same metrics for quantifying the temporal correlations between brain
	regions. In this paper, we use a public-domain test--retest resting-state
	fMRI data set to perform a systematic investigation of the stability
	of the metrics that are often used in resting-state functional connectivity
	(FC) studies. The fMRI data set was collected across three different
	sessions. The second session took place approximately eleven months
	after the first session, and the third session was an hour after
	the second session. The FC metrics composed of cross-correlation,
	partial cross-correlation, cross-coherence, and parameters based
	on an autoregressive model. We discussed the strengths and weaknesses
	of each metric. We performed ROI-level and full-brain seed-based
	voxelwise test--retest analyses using each FC metric to assess its
	stability. For both ROI-level and voxel-level analyses, we found
	that cross-correlation yielded more stable measurements than the
	other metrics. We discussed the consequences of this result on the
	utility of the FC metrics. We observed that for negatively correlated
	ROIs, their partial cross-correlation is shrunk towards zero, thus
	affecting the stability of their FC. For the present data set, we
	found greater stability in FC between the second and third sessions
	(one hour between sessions) compared to the first and second sessions
	(approximately 11 months between sessions). Finally, we report that
	some of the metrics showed a positive association between strength
	and stability. In summary, the results presented in this paper suggest
	important implications when choosing metrics for quantifying and
	assessing various types of functional connectivity for resting-state
	fMRI studies. \^{a}º We perform a test--retest analysis on functional
	connectivity. \^{a}º We use a random-effects ANOVA model for the
	test--retest analysis. \^{a}º We give an overview of and discuss
	the popular metrics for functional connectivity. \^{a}º Cross-correlation
	was the most stable metric for functional connectivity.}},

	For example, McCullagh reached negative conclusions about the use

	the effect of different ways of modelling clustered data, the criteria
	for successful bootstraps used in the literature and extending the
	theory from functions of the sample mean to include functions of
	the between and within sums of squares and non-parametric bootstraps
	to include model-based bootstraps. We determine that the consistency
	of variance estimates for a bootstrap method depends on the choice
	of model with the residual bootstrap giving consistency under the
	transformation model whereas the cluster bootstrap gives consistent
	estimates under both the transformation and the random-effect model.
	In addition we note that the criteria based on the distribution of

	METHODS: The Vienna Trans-Danube Aging Study investigated every inhabitant
	of the area on the left shore of the river Danube who was born between
	May 1925 and June 1926. With use of the official voting registry,
	1505 subjects were contacted and 697 participated. Data refer to

	was possible in 476 probands (35 deceased). RESULTS: The 141 patients

	41 of these patients with MCI were diagnosed with AD. Conversion
	rates to AD were 48.7\% (CI: 32.4 to 65.2) for amnestic MCI and 26.8\%

	Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) showed a high probability

	the latter defined as unresponsiveness to verbal commands. During
	awake baseline and each of the three levels of sedation, two scans
	were acquired after injection of an H215O bolus. Global as well as
	regional CBF were determined and correlated with propofol concentrations.
	In addition, blood flow changes in the thalamus were correlated with
	those of the entire scanned volume to determine areas of coordinated
	changes.In addition to a generalized decrease in global CBF, large
	regional decreases in CBF occurred bilaterally in the medial thalamus,
	the cuneus and precuneus, and the posterior cingulate, orbitofrontal,

	(3 wk) training in the task. Short-term learning was associated with
	decreases in activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate,

	increased activation in the right cerebellar dentate nucleus, the
	left putamen, and left thalamus. Prefrontal, parietal, and cerebellar

	for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) often use a target or template
	volume to facilitate processing, take advantage of prior information,

	literature, the MNI305 Talairach-like coordinate system is often
	used as a standard template. However, when studying pediatric populations,
	variation from the adult brain makes the MNI305 suboptimal for processing

	pediatric data. This paper presents the methods used to create unbiased,
	age-appropriate MRI atlas templates for pediatric studies that represent
	the average anatomy for the age range of 4.5-18.5 years, while maintaining
	a high level of anatomical detail and contrast. The creation of anatomical
	T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and proton density-weighted templates for
	specific developmentally important age-ranges, used data derived
	from the largest epidemiological, representative (healthy and normal)
	sample of the U.S. population, where each subject was carefully screened
	for medical and psychiatric factors and characterized using established
	neuropsychological and behavioral assessments. Use of these age-specific
	templates was evaluated by computing average tissue maps for gray
	matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid for each specific age
	range, and by conducting an exemplar voxel-wise deformation-based
	morphometry study using 66 young (4.5-6.9 years) participants to
	demonstrate the benefits of using the age-appropriate templates.
	The public availability of these atlases/templates will facilitate
	analysis of pediatric MRI data and enable comparison of results between
	studies in a common standardized space specific to pediatric research.

	a variety of regional parcellation templates, which can vary both
	in the volume sampled by each region, and the number of regions parcellated.
	Here, we sought to investigate how such variations in parcellation

	different parcellation resolutions (84, 91, 230, 438, 890, 1314,

	this view, with nearly two decades of research providing abundant
	evidence of structural and functional connectivity abnormalities
	in the disorder. In recent years, our understanding of how schizophrenia
	affects brain networks has been greatly advanced by attempts to map
	the complete set of inter-regional interactions comprising the brain's
	intricate web of connectivity; i.e., the human connectome. Imaging
	connectomics refers to the use of neuroimaging techniques to generate
	these maps which, combined with the application of graph theoretic
	methods, has enabled relatively comprehensive mapping of brain network
	connectivity and topology in unprecedented detail. Here, we review
	the application of these techniques to the study of schizophrenia,
	focusing principally on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research,
	while drawing attention to key methodological issues in the field.
	The published findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with
	a widespread and possibly context-independent functional connectivity
	deficit, upon which are superimposed more circumscribed, context-dependent
	alterations associated with transient states of hyper- and/or hypo-connectivity.
	In some cases, these changes in inter-regional functional coupling
	dynamics can be related to measures of intra-regional dysfunction.
	Topological disturbances of functional brain networks in schizophrenia
	point to reduced local network connectivity and modular structure,
	as well as increased global integration and network robustness. Some,
	but not all, of these functional abnormalities appear to have an
	anatomical basis, though the relationship between the two is complex.
	By comprehensively mapping connectomic disturbances in patients with
	schizophrenia across the entire brain, this work has provided important
	insights into the highly distributed character of neural abnormalities
	in the disorder, and the potential functional consequences that these

  abstract = {{Many real-world networks tend to be very dense. Particular examples
	of interest arise in the construction of networks that represent
	pairwise similarities between objects. In these cases, the networks
	under consideration are weighted, generally with positive weights
	between any two nodes. Visualization and analysis of such networks,
	especially when the number of nodes is large, can pose significant
	challenges which are often met by reducing the edge set. Any effective
	\^{a}€{\oe}sparsification\^{a}€� must retain and reflect the important
	structure in the network. A common method is to simply apply a hard
	threshold, keeping only those edges whose weight exceeds some predetermined
	value. A more principled approach is to extract the multiscale \^{a}€{\oe}backbone\^{a}€�
	of a network by retaining statistically significant edges through
	hypothesis testing on a specific null model, or by appropriately
	transforming the original weight matrix before applying some sort
	of threshold. Unfortunately, approaches such as these can fail to
	capture multiscale structure in which there can be small but locally
	statistically significant similarity between nodes. In this paper,
	we introduce a new method for backbone extraction that does not rely
	on any particular null model, but instead uses the empirical distribution
	of similarity weight to determine and then retain statistically significant
	edges. We show that our method adapts to the heterogeneity of local
	edge weight distributions in several paradigmatic real world networks,
	and in doing so retains their multiscale structure with relatively
	insignificant additional computational costs. We anticipate that
	this simple approach will be of great use in the analysis of massive,
	highly connected weighted networks.}},

	attention-demanding task? Second, what effect does a sustained attention-demanding

	task. We compared intrinsic activity during rest and the two-back
	task to the signal increases and decreases observed in an epoch-related

	intrinsic activity in the default-mode network is not extinguished
	but rather attenuated during performance of the working memory task.
	Moreover, we show that the intrinsic activity in the task-positive

	functional connectivity within the default mode network during both

	insight into effective connectivity within neuronal networks. Prominent
	features of functional connectivity within the default mode network
	included an overall strong level of interaction between the precuneus/posterior
	cingulate region and the rest of the default mode network, as well
	as a high degree of interaction between the left and right medial
	temporal lobes combined with weak interactions between the medial
	temporal lobes and the rest of the default mode network. Additionally,
	we found support for strong interactions between the precuneus/posterior

  abstract = {{We explore the idea of evidence accumulation (EAC) for combining
	the results of multiple clusterings. First, a clustering ensemble---a
	set of object partitions, is produced. Given a data set (n objects
	or patterns in d dimensions), different ways of producing data partitions
	are: 1) applying different clustering algorithms and 2) applying
	the same clustering algorithm with different values of parameters
	or initializations. Further, combinations of different data representations
	(feature spaces) and clustering algorithms can also provide a multitude
	of significantly different data partitionings. We propose a simple
	framework for extracting a consistent clustering, given the various
	partitions in a clustering ensemble. According to the EAC concept,
	each partition is viewed as an independent evidence of data organization,
	individual data partitions being combined, based on a voting mechanism,
	to generate a new n \times n similarity matrix between the n patterns.
	The final data partition of the n patterns is obtained by applying
	a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm on this matrix.
	We have developed a theoretical framework for the analysis of the
	proposed clustering combination strategy and its evaluation, based
	on the concept of mutual information between data partitions. Stability
	of the results is evaluated using bootstrapping techniques. A detailed
	discussion of an evidence accumulation-based clustering algorithm,
	using a split and merge strategy based on the K-means clustering
	algorithm, is presented. Experimental results of the proposed method
	on several synthetic and real data sets are compared with other combination
	strategies, and with individual clustering results produced by well-known

	paper describes a hybrid 3D image segmentation method which combines
	region growing and deformable models to obtain accurate and topologically
	preserving surface structures of anatomical objects of interest.
	The proposed strategy starts by determining a rough but robust approximation
	of the objects using a region-growing algorithm. Then, the closed
	surface mesh that encloses the region is constructed and used as
	the initial geometry of a deformable model for the final refinement.
	This integrated strategy provides an alternative solution to one
	of the flaws of traditional deformable models, achieving good refinements
	of internal surfaces in few steps. Experimental segmentation results
	of complex anatomical structures on both simulated and real data
	from MRI scans are presented, and the method is assessed by comparing
	with standard reference segmentations of head MRI. The evaluation
	was mainly based on the average overlap measure, which was tested
	on the segmentation of white matter, corresponding to a simulated
	brain data set, showing excellent performance exceeding 90\% accuracy.
	In addition, the algorithm was applied to the detection of anatomical
	head structures on two real MRI and one CT data set. The final reconstructions

	Here we analyze several procedures' robustness against increasing
	numbers of differentially expressed genes and varying proportions
	of up-regulation. Methods: Raw probe data from oligo-nucleotide microarrays
	are assumed to be approximately mulrivoriote normally distributed
	on the log scale. Chips can be simulated from a multivariate normal
	distribution with mean and voriance-covarionce matrix estimated from
	a real raw data set. A chip effect induces strong positive correlations.
	In reverse, sampling from a normal distribution with strong correlation
	variance-covariance matrix generates data exhibiting a chip effect.
	No explicit model of chip-effect is needed. Differences can be artificially
	spiked-in according to a given distribution of effect sizes. Thirty
	preprocessing procedures combining background correction, normalization,
	perfect match correction and summarization methods available from

	setting "50\% differentially expressed genes, 50\% of which up-regulated"
	background correction reduces bias, but inflates low intensity probe
	variance as well as the mean squared error of the estimates. Any
	normalization reduces variance and increases sensitivity with no
	clear winner. Asymmetry between up and down regulation causes bias
	in the effect-size estimate of non-differentially expressed genes.
	This markedly inflates the false positive discovery rates. Variance

  abstract = {Temporal stability during an fMRI acquisition is very important because
	the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) effects of interest are only
	a few percent in magnitude. Also, studies involving the collection
	of groups of subjects over time require stable scanner performance
	over days, weeks, months, and even years. We describe a protocol
	designed by one of the authors that has been tested for several years
	within the context of a large, multicenter collaborative fMRI research
	project (FIRST-BIRN). A full description of the phantom, the quality
	assurance (QA) protocol, and the several calculations used to measure
	performance is provided. The results obtained with this protocol
	at multiple sites over time are presented. These data can be used
	as benchmarks for other centers involved in fMRI research. Some issues
	with the various protocol measures are highlighted and discussed,
	and possible protocol improvements are also suggested. Overall, we
	expect that other fMRI centers will find this approach to QA useful
	and this report may facilitate developing a similar QA protocol locally.
	Based on the findings reported herein, the authors are convinced
	that monitoring QA in this way will improve the quality of fMRI data.

  abstract = {Variation in scanner performance will lead to variation in activation
	patterns in multicenter fMRI studies. The purpose of this investigation
	was to evaluate the effect of statistically covarying for scanner
	differences in signal-to-fluctuation-noise-ratio (SFNR) on reducing
	scanner differences in activation effect size as part of a multicenter
	fMRI project (FIRST BIRN). For SFNR, “signal” is typically the mean
	intensity over time and “fluctuation noise” is the temporal standard
	deviation. Five subjects were sent to 9 centers (10 scanners) and
	scanned on two consecutive days using a sensorimotor fMRI protocol.
	High-field (4 T and 3 T) and low-field (1.5 T) scanners from three
	vendors (GE, Siemens and Picker) were included. The effect size for
	the detection of neural activation during a sensorimotor task was
	evaluated as the percent of temporal variance accounted for by our
	model (percent of variance accounted for, or PVAF). Marked scanner
	effects were noted for both PVAF as well as SFNR. After covariate
	adjustment with one of several measures of SFNR, there were dramatic
	reductions in scanner-to-scanner variations in activation effect
	size. Variance components analyses revealed 75%–81% reductions in
	variance due to scanner with this method. Thus, controlling for scanner
	variation in SFNR may be an effective method to homogenize activation
	effect sizes in multicenter studies.},

	maps in functional MRI (fMRI) is a delicate issue. The use of advanced
	test statistics and/or the complex dependence structure of fMRI noise
	may preclude parametric statistical methods for finding appropriate
	thresholds. Non-parametric statistical methodology has been presented
	as a feasible alternative. In this paper, we discuss resampling methods
	for finding thresholds in single subject fMRI analysis. It is shown
	that the presence of a BOLD response in the time series biases the
	estimation of the temporal autocorrelation, which in turn leads to
	biased thresholds. Therefore, proposed resampling methods based on
	Fourier and wavelet transforms, which employ implicit and weak models
	of the temporal noise characteristic, may produce erroneous thresholds.
	In contrast, resampling based on a pre-whitening transform, which
	is driven by an explicit noise model, is robust to the presence of
	a BOLD response. The size of the bias is, however, largely dependent

	cortical area, in terms of an interaction between the influence of
	another area and some experimental (sensory or task-related) parameter.
	We refer to these effects aspsychophysiological interactionsand relate
	them to interactions based solely on experimental factors (i.e.,
	psychological interactions), in factorial designs, and interactions
	among neurophysiological measurements (i.e., physiological interactions).
	We have framed psychophysiological interactions in terms of functional
	integration by noting that the degree to which the activity in one
	area can be predicted, on the basis of activity in another, corresponds
	to the contribution of the second to the first, where this contribution
	can be related to effective connectivity. A psychophysiological interaction
	means that the contribution of one area to another changes significantly
	with the experimental or psychological context. Alternatively these
	interactions can be thought of as a contribution-dependent change
	in regional responses to an experimental or psychological factor.
	In other words the contribution can be thought of as modulating the
	responses elicited by a particular stimulus or psychological process.
	The potential importance of this approach lies in (i) conferring
	a degree of functional specificity on this aspect of effective connectivity
	and (ii) providing a model of modulation, where the contribution
	from a distal area can be considered to modulate responses to the
	psychological or stimulus-specific factor defining the interaction.
	Although distinct in neurobiological terms, these are equivalent
	perspectives on the same underlying interaction. We illustrate these
	points using a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of attention
	to visual motion and a position emission tomography study of visual
	priming. We focus on interactions among extrastriate, inferotemporal,

  abstract = {{In this paper we present an approach to the identification of nonlinear
	input--state--output systems. By using a bilinear approximation to
	the dynamics of interactions among states, the parameters of the
	implicit causal model reduce to three sets. These comprise (1) parameters
	that mediate the influence of extrinsic inputs on the states, (2)
	parameters that mediate intrinsic coupling among the states, and
	(3) [bilinear] parameters that allow the inputs to modulate that
	coupling. Identification proceeds in a Bayesian framework given known,
	deterministic inputs and the observed responses of the system. We
	developed this approach for the analysis of effective connectivity
	using experimentally designed inputs and fMRI responses. In this
	context, the coupling parameters correspond to effective connectivity
	and the bilinear parameters reflect the changes in connectivity induced
	by inputs. The ensuing framework allows one to characterise fMRI
	experiments, conceptually, as an experimental manipulation of integration
	among brain regions (by contextual or trial-free inputs, like time
	or attentional set) that is revealed using evoked responses (to perturbations
	or trial-bound inputs, like stimuli). As with previous analyses of
	effective connectivity, the focus is on experimentally induced changes
	in coupling (cf., psychophysiologic interactions). However, unlike
	previous approaches in neuroimaging, the causal model ascribes responses
	to designed deterministic inputs, as opposed to treating inputs as
	unknown and stochastic.}},

	in evoked responses in fMRI, particularly with the advent of event-related
	fMRI. These nonlinearities are commonly expressed as interactions
	among stimuli that can lead to the suppression and increased latency
	of responses to a stimulus that are incurred by a preceding stimulus.
	We have presented previously a model-free characterization of these
	effects using generic techniques from nonlinear system identification,
	namely a Volterra series formulation. At the same time Buxton et
	al. (1998) described a plausible and compelling dynamical model of
	hemodynamic signal transduction in fMRI. Subsequent work by Mandeville
	et al. (1999) provided important theoretical and empirical constraints
	on the form of the dynamic relationship between blood flow and volume
	that underpins the evolution of the fMRI signal. In this paper we
	combine these system identification and model-based approaches and
	ask whether the Balloon model is sufficient to account for the nonlinear
	behaviors observed in real time series. We conclude that it can,
	and furthermore the model parameters that ensue are biologically
	plausible. This conclusion is based on the observation that the Balloon
	model can produce Volterra kernels that emulate empirical kernels.
	To enable this evaluation we had to embed the Balloon model in a
	hemodynamic input-state-output model that included the dynamics of
	perfusion changes that are contingent on underlying synaptic activation.
	This paper presents (i) the full hemodynamic model (ii), how its
	associated Volterra kernels can be derived, and (iii) addresses the
	model's validity in relation to empirical nonlinear characterisations
	of evoked responses in fMRI and other neurophysiological constraints.}},

	history thus will itself be a function of previous positions, suggesting
	an autoregression-moving average model for the effects of previous

	Cortex based alignment (CBA), an advanced surface based alignment

	subjects' brains to a dynamic group average, was used to maximise
	anatomical correspondence across subjects. Cross subject spatial
	correlations of the RSN maps (independent components) were carried

	this gain was not uniform across RSNs. The observed increase in similarity
	of the functional RSNs after anatomical alignment illustrates that

  abstract = {{Classifier learning with data-sets that suffer from imbalanced class
	distributions is a challenging problem in data mining community.
	This issue occurs when the number of examples that represent one
	class is much lower than the ones of the other classes. Its presence
	in many real-world applications has brought along a growth of attention
	from researchers. In machine learning, the ensemble of classifiers
	are known to increase the accuracy of single classifiers by combining
	several of them, but neither of these learning techniques alone solve
	the class imbalance problem, to deal with this issue the ensemble
	learning algorithms have to be designed specifically. In this paper,
	our aim is to review the state of the art on ensemble techniques
	in the framework of imbalanced data-sets, with focus on two-class
	problems. We propose a taxonomy for ensemble-based methods to address
	the class imbalance where each proposal can be categorized depending
	on the inner ensemble methodology in which it is based. In addition,
	we develop a thorough empirical comparison by the consideration of
	the most significant published approaches, within the families of
	the taxonomy proposed, to show whether any of them makes a difference.
	This comparison has shown the good behavior of the simplest approaches
	which combine random undersampling techniques with bagging or boosting
	ensembles. In addition, the positive synergy between sampling techniques
	and bagging has stood out. Furthermore, our results show empirically
	that ensemble-based algorithms are worthwhile since they outperform
	the mere use of preprocessing techniques before learning the classifier,
	therefore justifying the increase of complexity by means of a significant
	enhancement of the results.}},

	of brain function and is of interest because its component brain
	regions are believed to be abnormal in schizophrenia. It was hypothesized
	that the default mode network would show abnormal activation and
	connectivity in patients with schizophrenia. METHOD: Patients with
	schizophrenia (N=21) and healthy comparison subjects (N=22) performed
	an auditory oddball task during functional magnetic resonance imaging
	(fMRI). Independent component analysis was used to identify the default
	mode component. Differences in the spatial and temporal aspects of
	the default mode network were examined in patients versus comparison
	subjects. RESULTS: Healthy comparison subjects and patients had significant
	spatial differences in the default mode network, most notably in
	the frontal, anterior cingulate, and parahippocampal gyri. In addition,
	activity in patients in the medial frontal, temporal, and cingulate
	gyri correlated with severity of positive symptoms. The patients
	also showed significantly higher frequency fluctuations in the temporal
	evolution of the default mode. CONCLUSIONS: Schizophrenia is associated
	with altered temporal frequency and spatial location of the default
	mode network. The authors hypothesized that this network may be under-
	or overmodulated by key regions, including the anterior and posterior
	cingulate cortex. In addition, the altered temporal fluctuations
	in patients may result from a change in the connectivity of these

	connectivity (RSFC) remains relatively uncharacterized. In the present
	study, we examine non-homotopic regions, characterizing heterotopic
	RSFC and comparing it to intrahemispheric RSFC, to examine the impact
	of hemispheric separation on the integration and segregation of processing
	in the brain. Resting-state fMRI scans were acquired from 59 healthy
	participants to examine inter-regional correlations in spontaneous
	low frequency fluctuations in BOLD signal. Using a probabilistic
	atlas, we correlated probability-weighted time series from 112 regions
	(56 per hemisphere) distributed throughout the entire cerebrum. We
	compared RSFC for pairings of non-homologous regions located in different
	hemispheres (heterotopic connectivity) to RSFC for the same pairings
	when located within hemisphere (intrahemispheric connectivity). For
	positive connections, connectivity strength was greater within each
	hemisphere, consistent with integrated intrahemispheric processing.
	However, for negative connections, RSFC strength was greater between
	the hemispheres, consistent with segregated interhemispheric processing.
	These patterns were particularly notable for connections involving
	frontal and heteromodal regions. The distribution of positive and

	derived from neuroimaging data has been a long-standing problem.
	With at least one test performed for every voxel in an image, some
	correction of the thresholds is needed to control the error rates,
	but standard procedures for multiple hypothesis testing (e.g., Bonferroni)
	tend to not be sensitive enough to be useful in this context. This
	paper introduces to the neuroscience literature statistical procedures
	for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Recent theoretical
	work in statistics suggests that FDR-controlling procedures will
	be effective for the analysis of neuroimaging data. These procedures
	operate simultaneously on all voxelwise test statistics to determine
	which tests should be considered statistically significant. The innovation
	of the procedures is that they control the expected proportion of
	the rejected hypotheses that are falsely rejected. We demonstrate
	this approach using both simulations and functional magnetic resonance
	imaging data from two simple experiments. (C)2002 Elsevier Science

	of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in predicting Alzheimer's disease
	(AD), further study of this construct and conversion rates is essential
	before use in clinical settings. We aimed to develop an operational
	definition of MCI consistent with criteria proposed by the Mayo Alzheimer's
	Disease Center, and to examine its conversion rate to AD. METHODS:
	Patients were identified from an inception cohort of patients with
	at least a 3-month history of memory problems, and referred to a
	2-year university teaching hospital investigation by primary care
	physicians. We classified 161 nondemented patients at baseline using
	MCI criteria. Diagnostic workups were completed annually, and patients
	were classified as meeting criteria for AD or showing no evidence
	of dementia after 1 and 2 years. RESULTS: Of 161 patients, 35\% met
	MCI criteria at baseline. Conversion rates to AD were 41\% after
	1 year, and 64\% after 2 years. Logistic regression analyses to examine
	predictive accuracy of MCI after 1 and 2 years, with age and education
	as covariates, were significant (p < 0.0001). After 1 year, MCI showed
	an optimal sensitivity of 91\% and specificity of 79\%, and after
	2 years, these values were 88 and 83\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
	MCI is an accurate predictor of AD over 1 and 2 years in patients
	referred by their primary care physicians. Discrepancies in conversion
	rates may be due to the manner in which patients are recruited to
	studies as well as the use of different measures to operationalize
	the construct.}},

	Consensus is by far the best performer in terms of predictive power

	it may be of no use because of its non-trivial computer time demand
	(weeks on a state of the art PC). FOM is the second best performer
	although, quite surprisingly, it may not be competitive in this scenario:
	it has essentially the same predictive power of WCSS but it is from
	6 to 100 times slower in time, depending on the dataset. The approximation
	algorithms for the computation of FOM, Gap and WCSS perform very
	well, i.e., they are faster while still granting a very close approximation
	of FOM and WCSS. The approximation algorithm for the computation
	of Gap deserves to be singled-out since it has a predictive power
	far better than Gap, it is competitive with the other measures, but
	it is at least two order of magnitude faster in time with respect
	to Gap. Another important novel conclusion that can be drawn from
	our analysis is that all the measures we have considered show severe
	limitations on large datasets, either due to computational demand

	allows intermediate execution data products to influence the generation
	of the following portions of the workflow. We have implemented this
	approach in Wings, a workflow creation Bellec2010asystem that combines semantic

	is thought to characterize basal neural activity. Aberrant default-mode
	connectivity has been reported in a host of neurological and psychiatric
	illnesses and in persons at genetic risk for such illnesses. Whereas
	the neurophysiologic mechanisms that regulate default-mode connectivity
	are unclear, there is growing evidence that genetic factors play
	a role. In this report, we estimate the importance of genetic effects
	on the default-mode network by examining covariation patterns in
	functional connectivity among 333 individuals from 29 randomly selected
	extended pedigrees. Heritability for default-mode functional connectivity
	was 0.424 $\pm$ 0.17 (P = 0.0046). Although neuroanatomic variation
	in this network was also heritable, the genetic factors that influence
	default-mode functional connectivity and gray-matter density seem
	to be distinct, suggesting that unique genes influence the structure
	and function of the network. In contrast, significant genetic correlations
	between regions within the network provide evidence that the same
	genetic factors contribute to variation in functional connectivity
	throughout the default mode. Specifically, the left parahippocampal
	region was genetically correlated with all other network regions.
	In addition, the posterior cingulate/precuneus region, medial prefrontal
	cortex, and right cerebellum seem to form a subnetwork. Default-mode
	functional connectivity is influenced by genetic factors that cannot
	be attributed to anatomic variation or a single region within the
	network. By establishing the heritability of default-mode functional
	connectivity, this experiment provides the obligatory evidence required
	before these measures can be considered as endophenotypes for psychiatric

	An optimization of the selected algorithm with regard to different

	of the distance between two time courses, considered as p-dimensional

	A clear mathematical description of the algorithm is proposed, and

	function given by the algorithm and the probability are clearly exposed.
	The algorithm was tested on artificial data sets, as well as on data

	applied to a network of distributed brain regions. We applied SEM
	to an fMRI dataset to identify condition-specific effects in a simple
	experiment composed of visual stimulation and baseline conditions.
	The visual network was composed of three well-defined anatomical
	regions (V1, V2, and V5) and three path connections (V1 --> V2, V1
	--> V5, and V2 --> V5). This network was used to test four hypotheses:
	(1) whether the condition-specific effects for all three connections
	vary according to the data selected for modelling; (2) whether the
	"summary" measures that are often used are indeed appropriate; (3)
	whether measures taken from the voxel timecourse can reliably predict
	the condition-specific effects for each one of the three path connections,
	and (4) whether all voxels within an anatomical region yield equivalent
	SEM outcomes. There was some variability in the significance of the
	condition-specific effects across randomly selected voxels within
	regions. However, the SEM outcome from the "summary" measures was
	comparable to the most frequent pattern of condition-specific effects.
	Magnitude, delay, spread, and goodness-of-fit measures taken from
	a gamma fit to the voxel time courses predicted reliably the significance
	of the SEM condition-specific effects for each connection. This result
	enabled us to identify spatially coherent regions at the boundaries
	of V2 that displayed different condition-specific effects from those
	seen in the majority of the voxels. Although the generality of these
	results awaits further investigation, this example highlights a number
	of important issues for SEM. We have provided further evidence that
	the SEM outcome does vary somewhat according to the voxels selected
	and that, although the use of summary measures can give a generalised
	view of the connectivity pattern, they could fail to capture functional
	differences within specialised areas.}},

	underlying the structural and functional organization of the brain
	is a basic challenge in neuroscience. However, direct evidence for
	anatomical connectivity networks in the human brain remains scarce.
	Here, we utilized diffusion tensor imaging deterministic tractography
	to construct a macroscale anatomical network capturing the underlying
	common connectivity pattern of human cerebral cortex in a large sample
	of subjects (80 young adults) and further quantitatively analyzed
	its topological properties with graph theoretical approaches. The
	cerebral cortex was divided into 78 cortical regions, each representing
	a network node, and 2 cortical regions were considered connected
	if the probability of fiber connections exceeded a statistical criterion.
	The topological parameters of the established cortical network (binarized)
	resemble that of a "small-world" architecture characterized by an
	exponentially truncated power-law distribution. These characteristics
	imply high resilience to localized damage. Furthermore, this cortical
	network was characterized by major hub regions in association cortices
	that were connected by bridge connections following long-range white
	matter pathways. Our results are compatible with previous structural
	and functional brain networks studies and provide insight into the

  journal = {Frontiers in neuroinformatics},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {5},
  abstract = {{ One of the most promising avenues for compiling connectivity data
	originates from the notion that individual brain regions maintain
	individual connectivity profiles; the functional repertoire of a
	cortical area ("the functional fingerprint") is closely related to
	its anatomical connections ("the connectional fingerprint") and,
	hence, a segregated cortical area may be characterized by a highly
	coherent connectivity pattern. Diffusion tractography can be used
	to identify borders between such cortical areas. Each cortical area
	is defined based upon a unique probabilistic tractogram and such
	a tractogram is representative of a group of tractograms, thereby
	forming the cortical area. The underlying methodology is called connectivity-based
	cortex parcellation and requires clustering or grouping of similar
	diffusion tractograms. Despite the relative success of this technique
	in producing anatomically sensible results, existing clustering techniques
	in the context of connectivity-based parcellation typically depend
	on several non-trivial assumptions. In this paper, we embody an unsupervised
	hierarchical information-based framework to clustering probabilistic
	tractograms that avoids many drawbacks offered by previous methods.
	Cortex parcellation of the inferior frontal gyrus together with the
	precentral gyrus demonstrates a proof of concept of the proposed
	method: The automatic parcellation reveals cortical subunits consistent
	with cytoarchitectonic maps and previous studies including connectivity-based
	parcellation. Further insight into the hierarchically modular architecture
	of cortical subunits is given by revealing coarser cortical structures
	that differentiate between primary as well as premotoric areas and
	those associated with pre-frontal areas. }},

	training new personnel takes time; (4) Neuroimaging software packages
	do not address computational efficiency; and (5) Methods sections
	in journal articles are inadequate for reproducing results. To address
	these issues, we present Nipype (Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines
	and Interfaces; http://nipy.org/nipype), an open-source, community-developed,
	software package, and scriptable library. Nipype solves the issues
	by providing Interfaces to existing neuroimaging software with uniform

	exploration of algorithms, eases the design of Workflows within and
	between packages, allows rapid comparative development of algorithms
	and reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages.
	Nipype supports both local and remote execution on multi-core machines
	and clusters, without additional scripting. Nipype is Berkeley Software
	Distribution licensed, allowing anyone unrestricted usage. An open,

	of activity across conditions were assessed, as well as functional
	connectivity of both networks. Younger adults showed a broader engagement
	of the DMN and older adults a more extensive engagement of the TPN.
	Functional connectivity in the DMN was reduced in older adults, whereas
	the main pattern of TPN connectivity was equivalent in the 2 groups.
	Age-specific connectivity also was seen in TPN regions. Increased
	activity in TPN areas predicted worse accuracy on the tasks, but
	greater expression of a connectivity pattern associated with a right
	dorsolateral prefrontal TPN region, seen only in older adults, predicted
	better performance. These results provide further evidence for age-related
	differences in the DMN and new evidence of age differences in the
	TPN. Increased use of the TPN may reflect greater demand on cognitive
	control processes in older individuals that may be partially offset
	by alterations in prefrontal functional connectivity.}},

	those who do not meet current criteria for dementia have received
	little study. We report a comprehensive estimate of the prevalence
	of "cognitive impairment, no dementia" (CIND) in an elderly population.
	METHODS: The Canadian Study of Health and Aging gathered population
	representation information about elderly Canadians aged 65 and over
	from 36 cities and surrounding areas in five regions. In each region,
	the sample size was 1800 people in the community and 250 people in
	institutions. Patients in the community were screened for cognitive
	impairment by means of the modified mini-mental state examination.
	Those who scored below the cut-off point (n = 1106) and a randomly
	selected sample of those who scored above the cut-off point (n =
	494) were referred for clinical examination. 59 individuals unable
	to take the screening test were also assessed clinically. We selected
	17 long-term care institutions in each region, and then randomly
	selected consenting residents of these institutions for clinical
	assessment (n = 1255). RESULTS: The prevalence of CIND was 16.8\%,
	which was more than all types of dementia combined (8.0\%). The prevalence
	of all types of cognitive impairment, including dementias, increased
	with age. Patients with CIND were three times more likely to be living
	in institutions than were cognitively unimpaired patients (odds ratio
	3-1 [95\% CI 2.4-3.9]). Circumscribed memory loss has a prevalence
	of 5.3\% in the elderly Canadian population, and was the most common
	category. CIND was related to some degree of functional impairment
	in elderly patients. INTERPRETATION: CIND is commonly associated
	with functional disability and a need for institutional care. This
	diagnostic category includes a costly group of disorders that merit
	further study.}},

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET) studies of major depression
	have revealed resting-state abnormalities in the prefrontal and cingulate
	cortices. Recently, fMRI has been adapted to examine connectivity
	within a specific resting-state neural network--the default-mode
	network--that includes medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices.
	The goal of this study was to examine resting-state, default-mode
	network functional connectivity in subjects with major depression
	and in healthy controls. METHODS: Twenty-eight subjects with major
	depression and 20 healthy controls underwent 5-min fMRI scans while
	resting quietly. Independent component analysis was used to isolate
	the default-mode network in each subject. Group maps of the default-mode
	network were compared. A within-group analysis was performed in the
	depressed group to explore effects of depression refractoriness on
	functional connectivity. RESULTS: Resting-state subgenual cingulate
	and thalamic functional connectivity with the default-mode network
	were significantly greater in the depressed subjects. Within the
	depressed group, the length of the current depressive episode correlated
	positively with functional connectivity in the subgenual cingulate.
	CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to explore default-mode functional
	connectivity in major depression. The findings provide cross-modality
	confirmation of PET studies demonstrating increased thalamic and
	subgenual cingulate activity in major depression. Further, the within-subject
	connectivity analysis employed here brings these previously isolated
	regions of hypermetabolism into the context of a disordered neural
	network. The correlation between refractoriness and subgenual cingulate
	functional connectivity within the network suggests that a quantitative,
	resting-state fMRI measure could be used to guide therapy in individual
	subjects.}},

	model for this dependence. When these interactions are measured using
	functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques, however,
	imaging and physiological artifacts create patterns of dependence
	that may be unrelated to cortical activity. We demonstrate some of
	these effects through the measurement of short-range dependencies
	present in fMRI scans of the primary visual cortex (V1) in the anaesthetized
	macaque monkey. High-field (4.7 T) fMRI scans were conducted to measure
	responses based on the blood oxygen level-dependent contrast mechanism,
	during periods of no sensory stimulation and of visual stimulation
	with rotating polar-transformed checkerboard gratings. Dependence
	between the haemodynamic activity at different spatial locations
	(i.e., different voxels) was measured using correlation, mutual information
	and functional covariance. Particular attention was paid to understanding
	the sources of spurious dependence that may be observed during such
	investigations. Two main effects were detected: (a) short-range correlations
	introduced by the process of image reconstruction and (b) perturbations
	in the haemodynamic response caused by breathing. The image reconstruction
	artifacts were shown to create an artificially high short-range dependence
	in the readout direction of the scan, and the breathing artifacts
	caused enhanced short-range dependence in both the readout and phase-encode
	directions. Additional dependence in the phase-encode direction due
	to image-ghosting is also possible but will not be discussed in this
	report, as it can be alleviated by fine adjustment of preemphasis
	(elimination of eddy currents). A technique is described for removing
	breathing artifacts, and the effect of breathing on the apparent
	dependence between voxels is illustrated. The correlation of haemodynamic
	activity with the stimulus was found to be affected by breathing,
	although this effect can be neutralised by averaging the haemodynamic
	responses over many repetitions of the stimulus. Nonetheless, patterns
	of dependent activity between voxels may be lost in this averaging
	process, which makes the removal of breathing artifacts necessary
	if statistical dependence and the study of effective connectivity
	is the primary aim of an investigation.}},

	and self-organizing maps) have been successful tools in the display
	and analysis of whole genome DNA microarray expression data. However,
	the results of hierarchical clustering are sensitive to outliers,
	and most relocation methods give results which are dependent on the
	initialization of the algorithm. Therefore, it is difficult to assess
	the significance of the results. We have developed a consensus clustering
	algorithm, where the final result is averaged over multiple clustering
	runs, giving a robust and reproducible clustering, capable of capturing
	small signal variations. The algorithm preserves valuable properties
	of hierarchical clustering, which is useful for visualization and
	interpretation of the results. RESULTS: We show for the first time
	that one can take advantage of multiple clustering runs in DNA microarray
	analysis by collecting re-occurring clustering patterns in a co-occurrence
	matrix. The results show that consensus clustering obtained from
	clustering multiple times with Variational Bayes Mixtures of Gaussians
	or K-means significantly reduces the classification error rate for
	a simulated dataset. The method is flexible and it is possible to
	find consensus clusters from different clustering algorithms. Thus,
	the algorithm can be used as a framework to test in a quantitative
	manner the homogeneity of different clustering algorithms. We compare
	the method with a number of state-of-the-art clustering methods.
	It is shown that the method is robust and gives low classification
	error rates for a realistic, simulated dataset. The algorithm is
	also demonstrated for real datasets. It is shown that more biological
	meaningful transcriptional patterns can be found without conservative
	statistical or fold-change exclusion of data. AVAILABILITY: Matlab

  abstract = {{Quantitative evaluation of brain MRI/SPECT fusion methods for normal
	and in particular pathological datasets is difficult, due to the
	frequent lack of relevant ground truth. We propose a methodology
	to generate MRI and SPECT datasets dedicated to the evaluation of
	MRI/SPECT fusion methods and illustrate the method when dealing with
	ictal SPECT. The method consists in generating normal or pathological
	SPECT data perfectly aligned with a high-resolution 3D T1-weighted
	MRI using realistic Monte Carlo simulations that closely reproduce
	the response of a SPECT imaging system. Anatomical input data for
	the SPECT simulations are obtained from this 3D T1-weighted MRI,
	while functional input data result from an inter-individual analysis
	of anatomically standardized SPECT data. The method makes it possible
	to control the 'brain perfusion' function by proposing a theoretical
	model of brain perfusion from measurements performed on real SPECT
	images. Our method provides an absolute gold standard for assessing
	MRI/SPECT registration method accuracy since, by construction, the
	SPECT data are perfectly registered with the MRI data. The proposed
	methodology has been applied to create a theoretical model of normal
	brain perfusion and ictal brain perfusion characteristic of mesial
	temporal lobe epilepsy. To approach realistic and unbiased perfusion
	models, real SPECT data were corrected for uniform attenuation, scatter
	and partial volume effect. An anatomic standardization was used to
	account for anatomic variability between subjects. Realistic simulations
	of normal and ictal SPECT deduced from these perfusion models are
	presented. The comparison of real and simulated SPECT images showed
	relative differences in regional activity concentration of less than
	20\% in most anatomical structures, for both normal and ictal data,
	suggesting realistic models of perfusion distributions for evaluation
	purposes. Inter-hemispheric asymmetry coefficients measured on simulated
	data were found within the range of asymmetry coefficients measured
	on corresponding real data. The features of the proposed approach
	are compared with those of other methods previously described to
	obtain datasets appropriate for the assessment of fusion methods.}},

	data, the purpose of this study is to characterize interindividual
	functional variability and functional connectivity between anatomic
	structures in a set of SPECT data acquired from a homogeneous population
	of subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From volume of interest (VOI)-perfusion
	measurements performed on anatomically standardized SPECT data, we
	proposed to use correspondence analysis (CA) and hierarchical clustering
	(HC) to explore the structure of statistical dependencies among these
	measurements. The method was applied to study the perfusion pattern
	in two populations of subjects; namely, SPECT data from 27 healthy
	subjects and ictal SPECT data from 10 patients with mesio-temporal
	lobe epilepsy (MTLE). RESULTS: For healthy subjects, anatomic structures
	showing statistically dependent perfusion patterns were classified
	into four groups; namely, temporomesial structures, internal structures,
	posterior structures, and remaining cortex. For patients with MTLE,
	they were classified as temporomesial structures, surrounding temporal
	structures, internal structures, and remaining cortex. Anatomic structures
	of each group showed similar perfusion behavior so that they may
	be functionally connected and may belong to the same network. Our
	main result is that the temporal pole and lenticular nucleus seemed
	to be highly relevant to characterize ictal perfusion in patients
	with MTLE. This exploratory analysis suggests that a network involving
	temporal structures, lenticular nucleus, brainstem, and cerebellum
	seems to be involved during MTLE seizures. CONCLUSION: CA followed
	by HC is a promising approach to explore brain perfusion patterns
	from SPECT VOI measurements.}},

  abstract = {{In the last decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
	has been introduced into clinical practice. As a consequence of this
	advanced noninvasive medical imaging technique, the analysis and
	visualization of medical image time-series data poses a new challenge
	to both research and medical application. But often, the model data
	for a regression or generalized linear model-based analysis are not
	available. Hence exploratory data-driven techniques, i.e. blind source
	separation (BSS) methods are very popular in functional nuclear magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis since they are neither based
	on explicit signal models nor on a priori knowledge of the underlying
	physiological process. The independent component analysis (ICA) represents
	a main BSS method which searches for stochastically independent signals
	from the multivariate observations. In this paper, we introduce a
	new kernel-based nonlinear ICA method and compare it to standard
	BSS techniques. This kernel nonlinear ICA (kICA) overcomes the restrictions
	of linearity of the mixing process usually encountered with ICA.
	Dimension reduction is an important preprocessing step for this nonlinear
	technique and is performed in a novel way: a genetic algorithm is
	designed which determines the optimal number of basis vectors for
	a reduced-order feature space representation as an optimization problem
	of the condition number of the resulting basis. For the fMRI data,
	a comparative quantitative evaluation is performed between kICA with
	different kernels, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and other
	BSS algorithms. The comparative results are evaluated by task-related
	activation maps, associated time courses and ROC study. The comparison
	is performed on fMRI data from experiments with 10 subjects. The
	external stimulus was a visual pattern presentation in a block design.
	The most important obtained results in this paper represent that
	kICA and sparse NMF (sNMF) are able to identify signal components
	with high correlation to the fMRI stimulus, and kICA with a Gaussian
	kernel is comparable to standard ICA algorithms and even more, it
	yields spatially focused results.}},

  abstract = {{Independent component analysis (ICA) is becoming increasingly popular
	for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.
	While ICA has been successfully applied to single-subject analysis,
	the extension of ICA to group inferences is not straightforward and
	remains an active topic of research. Current group ICA models, such
	as the GIFT [Calhoun, V.D., Adali, T., Pearlson, G.D., Pekar, J.J.,
	2001. A method for making group inferences from functional MRI data
	using independent component analysis. Hum. Brain Mapp. 14, 140-151.]
	and tensor PICA [Beckmann, C.F., Smith, S.M., 2005. Tensorial extensions
	of independent component analysis for multisubject FMRI analysis.
	Neuroimage 25, 294-311.], make different assumptions about the underlying
	structure of the group spatio-temporal processes and are thus estimated
	using algorithms tailored for the assumed structure, potentially
	leading to diverging results. To our knowledge, there are currently
	no methods for assessing the validity of different model structures
	in real fMRI data and selecting the most appropriate one among various
	choices. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for estimating
	and comparing group ICA models with varying spatio-temporal structures.
	We consider a class of group ICA models that can accommodate different
	group structures and include existing models, such as the GIFT and
	tensor PICA, as special cases. We propose a maximum likelihood (ML)
	approach with a modified Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm
	for the estimation of the proposed class of models. Likelihood ratio
	tests (LRT) are presented to compare between different group ICA
	models. The LRT can be used to perform model comparison and selection,
	to assess the goodness-of-fit of a model in a particular data set,
	and to test group differences in the fMRI signal time courses between
	subject subgroups. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the
	performance of the proposed method under varying structures of group
	spatio-temporal processes. We illustrate our group ICA method using
	data from an fMRI study that investigates changes in neural processing
	associated with the regular practice of Zen meditation.}},

	cerebellar systems in nonmotor functions. The functional anatomy
	of these systems has been pieced together from disparate sources,
	such as animal studies, lesion studies in humans, and structural
	and functional imaging studies in humans. To better define this distinct
	functional anatomy, in the current study we delineate the role of
	the cerebellum in several nonmotor systems simultaneously and in
	the same subjects using resting state functional connectivity MRI.
	Independent component analysis was applied to resting state data
	from two independent datasets to identify common cerebellar contributions
	to several previously identified intrinsic connectivity networks
	(ICNs) involved in executive control, episodic memory/self-reflection,
	salience detection, and sensorimotor function. We found distinct
	cerebellar contributions to each of these ICNs. The neocerebellum
	participates in (1) the right and left executive control networks
	(especially crus I and II), (2) the salience network (lobule VI),
	and (3) the default-mode network (lobule IX). Little to no overlap
	was detected between these cerebellar regions and the sensorimotor
	cerebellum (lobules V-VI). Clusters were also located in pontine
	and dentate nuclei, prominent points of convergence for cerebellar
	input and output, respectively. The results suggest that the most
	phylogenetically recent part of the cerebellum, particularly crus
	I and II, make contributions to parallel cortico-cerebellar loops
	involved in executive control, salience detection, and episodic memory/self-reflection.
	The largest portions of the neocerebellum take part in the executive
	control network implicated in higher cognitive functions such as

  abstract = {{Structurally segregated and functionally specialized regions of the
	human cerebral cortex are interconnected by a dense network of cortico-cortical
	axonal pathways. By using diffusion spectrum imaging, we noninvasively
	mapped these pathways within and across cortical hemispheres in individual
	human participants. An analysis of the resulting large-scale structural
	brain networks reveals a structural core within posterior medial
	and parietal cerebral cortex, as well as several distinct temporal
	and frontal modules. Brain regions within the structural core share
	high degree, strength, and betweenness centrality, and they constitute
	connector hubs that link all major structural modules. The structural
	core contains brain regions that form the posterior components of
	the human default network. Looking both within and outside of core
	regions, we observed a substantial correspondence between structural
	connectivity and resting-state functional connectivity measured in
	the same participants. The spatial and topological centrality of
	the core within cortex suggests an important role in functional integration.
	In the human brain, neural activation patterns are shaped by the
	underlying structural connections that form a dense network of fiber
	pathways linking all regions of the cerebral cortex. Using diffusion
	imaging techniques, which allow the noninvasive mapping of fiber
	pathways, we constructed connection maps covering the entire cortical
	surface. Computational analyses of the resulting complex brain network
	reveal regions of cortex that are highly connected and highly central,
	forming a structural core of the human brain. Key components of the
	core are portions of posterior medial cortex that are known to be
	highly activated at rest, when the brain is not engaged in a cognitively
	demanding task. Because we were interested in how brain structure
	relates to brain function, we also recorded brain activation patterns
	from the same participant group. We found that structural connection
	patterns and functional interactions between regions of cortex were
	significantly correlated. Based on our findings, we suggest that
	the structural core of the brain may have a central role in integrating
	information across functionally segregated brain regions.}},

	of the default mode network (DMN) remain unknown. Here we combined
	positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging
	to investigate modulations of the DMN via serotonin-1A receptors
	(5-HT1A), separated for 5-HT autoinhibition (dorsal raphe nucleus)
	and local inhibition (heteroreceptors in projection areas). Using
	two independent approaches, regional 5-HT1A binding consistently
	predicted DMN activity in the retrosplenial cortex for resting-state
	functional magnetic resonance imaging and the Tower of London task.
	On the other hand, both local and autoinhibitory 5-HT1A binding inversely
	modulated the posterior cingulate cortex, the strongest hub in the
	resting human brain. In the frontal part of the DMN, a negative association
	was found between the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and local 5-HT1A
	inhibition. Our results indicate a modulation of key areas involved
	in self-referential processing by serotonergic neurotransmission,
	whereas variations in 5-HT1A binding explained a considerable amount
	of the individual variability in the DMN. Moreover, the brain regions
	associated with distinct introspective functions seem to be specifically
	regulated by the different 5-HT1A binding sites. Together with previously
	reported modulations of dopamine and GABA, this regional specialization
	suggests complex interactions of several neurotransmitters driving
	the default mode network.}},

  abstract = {Although psychiatric disorders are, to date, diagnosed on the basis
	of behavioral symptoms and course of illness, the interest in neurobiological
	markers of psychiatric disorders has grown substantially in recent
	years. However, current classification approaches are mainly based
	on data from a single biomarker, making it difficult to predict disorders
	characterized by complex patterns of symptoms.To integrate neuroimaging
	data associated with multiple symptom-related neural processes and
	demonstrate their utility in the context of depression by deriving
	a predictive model of brain activation.Two groups of participants
	underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during 3 tasks probing
	neural processes relevant to depression.Participants were recruited
	from the local population by use of advertisements; participants
	with depression were inpatients from the Department of Psychiatry,
	Psychosomatics, and Psychotherapy at the University of Wuerzburg,
	Wuerzburg, Germany.We matched a sample of 30 medicated, unselected
	patients with depression by age, sex, smoking status, and handedness
	with 30 healthy volunteers.Accuracy of single-subject classification
	based on whole-brain patterns of neural responses from all 3 tasks.Integrating
	data associated with emotional and affective processing substantially
	increases classification accuracy compared with single classifiers.
	The predictive model identifies a combination of neural responses
	to neutral faces, large rewards, and safety cues as nonredundant
	predictors of depression. Regions of the brain associated with overall
	classification comprise a complex pattern of areas involved in emotional
	processing and the analysis of stimulus features.Our method of integrating
	neuroimaging data associated with multiple, symptom-related neural
	processes can provide a highly accurate algorithm for classification.
	The integrated biomarker model shows that data associated with both
	emotional and reward processing are essential for a highly accurate
	classification of depression. In the future, large-scale studies
	will need to be conducted to determine the practical applicability
	of our algorithm as a biomarker-based diagnostic aid.},

	these two themes together, using Edgeworth expansion to explore and
	develop the properites of the bootstrap. The book is aimed a a graduate
	level audience who has some exposure to the methods of theoretical
	statistics. However, technical details are delayed until the last
	chapter (entitled "Details of Mathematical Rogour"), and so a mathematically
	able reader without knowledge of the rigorous theory of probability
	will have no trouble understanding the first four-fifths of the book.
	The book simultaneously fills two gaps in the literature; it provides

  abstract = {{ This chapter reviews results of clinical and functional imaging
	studies which investigated the time-course of cortical and subcortical
	activation during the acquisition of motor a skill. During the early
	phases of learning by trial and error, activation in prefrontal areas,
	especially in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, is has been reported.
	The role of these areas is presumably related to explicit working
	memory and the establishment of a novel association between visual
	cues and motor commands. Furthermore, motor associated areas of the
	right hemisphere and distributed cerebellar areas reveal strong activation
	during the early motor learning. Activation in superior-posterior
	parietal cortex presumably arises from visuospatial processes, while
	sensory feedback is coded in the anterior-inferior parietal cortex
	and the neocerebellar structures. With practice, motor associated
	areas of the left-hemisphere reveal increased activity. This shift
	to the left hemisphere has been observed regardless of the hand used
	during training, indicating a left-hemispheric dominance in the storage
	of visuomotor skills. Concerning frontal areas, learned actions of
	sequential character are represented in the caudal part of the supplementary
	motor area (SMA proper), whereas the lateral premotor cortex appears
	to be responsible for the coding of the association between visuo-spatial
	information and motor commands. Functional imaging studies which
	investigated the activation patterns of motor learning under implicit
	conditions identified for the first, a motor circuit which includes
	lateral premotor cortex and SMA proper of the left hemisphere and
	primary motor cortex, for the second, a cognitive loop which consists
	of basal ganglia structures of the right hemisphere. Finally, activity
	patterns of intermanual transfer are discussed. After right-handed
	training, activity in motor associated areas maintains during performance
	of the mirror version, but is increased during the performance of
	the original-oriented version with the left hand. In contrary, increased
	activity during the mirror reversed action, but not during the original-oriented
	performance of the untrained right hand is observed after left-handed
	training. These results indicate the transfer of acquired right-handed
	information which reflects the mirror symmetry of the body, whereas
	spatial information is mainly transferred after left-handed training.
	Taken together, a combined approach of clinical lesion studies and
	functional imaging is a promising tool for identifying the cerebral
	regions involved in the process of motor learning and provides insight
	into the mechanisms underlying the generalisation of actions. }},

  abstract = {{Motivation The discovery of novel biological knowledge from the ab
	initio analysis of post-genomic data relies upon the use of unsupervised
	processing methods, in particular clustering techniques. Much recent
	research in bioinformatics has therefore been focused on the transfer
	of clustering methods introduced in other scientific fields and on
	the development of novel algorithms specifically designed to tackle
	the challenges posed by post-genomic data. The partitions returned
	by a clustering algorithm are commonly validated using visual inspection
	and concordance with prior biological knowledge---whether the clusters
	actually correspond to the real structure in the data is somewhat
	less frequently considered. Suitable computational cluster validation
	techniques are available in the general data-mining literature, but
	have been given only a fraction of the same attention in bioinformatics.Results
	This review paper aims to familiarize the reader with the battery
	of techniques available for the validation of clustering results,
	with a particular focus on their application to post-genomic data
	analysis. Synthetic and real biological datasets are used to demonstrate
	the benefits, and also some of the perils, of analytical cluster
	validation.Availability: The software used in the experiments is

  abstract = {{A mode-based clustering method is developed for identifying spatially
	dense clusters in brain maps. This type of clustering focuses on
	identifying clusters in brain maps independent of their shape or

	require more coherent or dense regions of interest as starting points.
	The method automatically does signal/noise sharpening through density
	mode seeking. We also discuss the problem of parameter selection
	with this method and propose a new method involving 2-parameter control
	surface, in which we show that the same cluster solution results
	from tradeoff of these 2 parameters (the local density k and the
	radius r of the spherical kernel). We benchmark the new dense mode
	clustering by using several artificially created data sets and brain
	imaging data sets from an event perception task by perturbing the
	data set with noise and measuring three kinds of deviation from the
	original cluster solution. We present benchmark results that demonstrate
	that the mode clustering method consistently outperforms the commonly
	used single-linkage clustering, k means method (centroid method)
	and Ward's method (variance method).}},

	Between the two states, we observed apparent increases and decreases

  abstract = {In everyday life, our actions are often guided by verbal instructions.
	Usually, we can implement such instructions immediately without trial
	and error learning. This raises the fundamental question how verbal
	instructions are transformed into efficient motor behavior. The aim
	of this study was to gain deeper insights into the implementation
	of verbal instructions both on a neural and a cognitive level. To
	this end, we devised an fMRI experiment in which participants were
	required to permanently implement new stimulus-response (S-R) mappings
	and object-color (O-C) mappings. This enabled us to test whether
	there are brain areas that are specific to the implementation of
	newly instructed S-R mappings or whether newly instructed rules are
	represented independently from the specific content. Furthermore,
	we could test which brain areas are involved in the processing of
	S-R mappings when compared with O-C mappings. Our results suggest
	that only one brain area, the left inferior frontal junction (IFJ),
	was sensitive to the novelty of instructions regardless of whether
	these instructions conveyed S-R or O-C mappings. Furthermore, our
	results show that instructions conveying S-R mapping involve a network
	of brain areas, including pre-PMd, M1, and IPS that was not sensitive
	to the novelty of the instructions. Therefore, we conclude that the
	implementation of verbal instructions results from an interplay of
	a brain areas that represent novel rulelike information in domain
	general terms and brain areas that are specific to S-R rules.},

  abstract = {{Because of their increased sensitivity to spatially extended signals,
	cluster-size tests are widely used to detect changes and activations
	in brain images. However, when images are nonstationary, the cluster-size
	distribution varies depending on local smoothness. Clusters tend
	to be large in smooth regions, resulting in increased false positives,
	while in rough regions, clusters tend to be small, resulting in decreased
	sensitivity. Worsley et al. proposed a random field theory (RFT)
	method that adjusts cluster sizes according to local roughness of
	images [Worsley, K.J., 2002. Nonstationary FWHM and its effect on
	statistical inference of fMRI data. Presented at the 8th International
	Conference on Functional Mapping of the Human Brain, June 2-6, 2002,
	Sendai, Japan. Available on CD-ROM in NeuroImage 16 (2) 779-780;
	Hum. Brain Mapp. 8 (1999) 98]. In this paper, we implement this method
	in a permutation test framework, which requires very few assumptions,
	is known to be exact [J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 16 (1996) 7] and
	is robust [NeuroImage 20 (2003) 2343]. We compared our method to
	stationary permutation, stationary RFT, and nonstationary RFT methods.
	Using simulated data, we found that our permutation test performs
	well under any setting examined, whereas the nonstationary RFT test
	performs well only for smooth images under high df. We also found
	that the stationary RFT test becomes anticonservative under nonstationarity,
	while both nonstationary RFT and permutation tests remain valid under
	nonstationarity. On a real PET data set we found that, though the
	nonstationary tests have reduced sensitivity due to smoothness estimation
	variability, these tests have better sensitivity for clusters in
	rough regions compared to stationary cluster-size tests. We include
	a detailed and consolidated description of Worsley nonstationary

	of connectivity is the correlation between the blood oxygenation
	level dependent (BOLD) time series observed in different brain regions.
	The computation of the correlation is often dominated by the presence
	of a strong global component that can introduce significant variability
	across functional connectivity maps acquired from different experimental
	scans or subjects. To address this issue, a variety of global signal
	correction methods have been proposed, but there is currently a lack
	of a clear consensus on the best approach to use. Furthermore, there
	has been concern that some global signal correction methods, such
	as global signal regression, may produce significant negative bias
	in the correlation values. In this paper we introduce a framework
	for visualizing the signal structure of resting-state fMRI data and
	characterizing the properties of the global signal. Using this framework,
	we demonstrate that a portion of the global signal can be viewed
	as an additive confound that increases with the mean BOLD amplitude.

	several recent studies have suggested that AD patients have disruptive

	deficits caused by this disease. In this review, we will summarize
	recent advances in the brain network research on AD, focusing mainly

  abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of dementia, including AD, among
	Canadians aged 65 and over. METHODS: A 5-year cohort study of 10,263
	seniors was undertaken, including community and institutional samples.
	The baseline study in 1991 identified 1,132 prevalent cases of dementia
	through screening and clinical examination. The remaining 9,131 cases
	formed the incidence study sample and were rescreened and selectively
	reexamined in 1996. Incident cases were diagnosed using established
	criteria. Incidence was estimated based on the 1991 population, and
	included data on those who died between the first and second phases
	of the study. RESULTS: Of the nondemented cohort who remained alive
	in 1996, 5,432 people in the community (88.3\%) and 210 (91.3\%)
	in the institutional sample participated in the incidence study.
	Nine hundred sixty incident cases were identified; the overall age-standardized
	incidence rates were 21.8 (women) and 19.1 (men) per 1,000 nondemented
	persons per year. This translates into 60,150 new cases of dementia
	per year in Canada. The logarithm of the rates rises linearly with
	age, but suggests a slight slowing of growth in incidence in the
	oldest age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our incidence estimates lie toward
	the upper end of the range of incidence estimates found in other
	studies. Nonetheless, we calculate that several factors may have
	biased our estimates downward, suggesting that the incidence of dementia
	may be higher than many studies have reported.}},

	This algorithm has several advantages over traditional distance-based
	agglomerative clustering algorithms. (1) It defines a probabilistic
	model of the data which can be used to compute the predictive distribution
	of a test point and the probability of it belonging to any of the
	existing clusters in the tree. (2) It uses a model-based criterion
	to decide on merging clusters rather than an ad-hoc distance metric.
	(3) Bayesian hypothesis testing is used to decide which merges are
	advantageous and to output the recommended depth of the tree. (4)
	The algorithm can be interpreted as a novel fast bottom-up approximate
	inference method for a Dirichlet process (i.e. countably infinite)
	mixture model (DPM). It provides a new lower bound on the marginal
	likelihood of a DPM by summing over exponentially many clusterings
	of the data in polynomial time. We describe procedures for learning
	the model hyperpa-rameters, computing the predictive distribution,

  abstract = {{ Summary Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to be the most common
	cause of late-life dementia. But pure AD is infrequent whereas AD
	pathology is often insufficient to explain dementia in the elderly.
	Conversely, cerebrovascular disease is omnipresent and the crucial
	role of microvascular alterations increasingly recognized in late
	dementia or '' Alzheimer syndrome''. Pathomechanisms of vascular
	cognitive impairment are still debated but recent data indicate that
	the initial concept of chronic low grade cerebral hypoxia should
	not have been abandoned. Thus, it is proposed that windkessel dysfunction
	is the missing link between vascular and craniospinal senescence
	on the one hand, and chronic low grade cerebral hypoxia, '' senile
	brain degeneration'' and '' Alzheimer syndrome'' on the other hand.
	An age-related decrease in the buffering capacity of both the vessels
	and the craniospinal cavity favours cerebral hypoxia; due to increased
	capillary pulsatility with disturbances in capillary exchanges or
	due to a marked reduction in craniospinal compliance with a mechanical
	reduction in cerebral arterial inflow. '' Invisible'' windkessel
	dysfunction, most often related to '' hardening of the arteries''
	may be the most frequent pathomechanism of late-onset dementia whereas
	associated mild or moderate AD may be merely a toxic manifestation
	of a primarily hypoxic disease. Structural patterns of arteriosclerotic
	dementia fit well with an underlying arterial windkessel dysfunction:
	with secondary mechanical damage to the cerebral small vessels and
	the brain and predominantly deep hypoxia. The clinical significance
	of leukoara\"{i}osis, small foci of necrosis, ventricular dilatation,
	hippocampal and cortical atrophy is in good agreement with their
	value as indirect markers of windkessel dysfunction. An age-related
	'' invisible'' reduction in craniospinal compliance may also contribute
	to the associations between heart failure, arterial hypotension and
	cognitive impairment in the elderly and to the high percentage of
	dementia of unknown origin in the very old. Both neuropathological
	and clinical overlap between AD and windkessel dysfunction can explain
	that cerebrovascular dysfunction remains misdiagnosed for AD in the
	elderly. Evidence of the key role of cerebrovascular dysfunction
	should markedly facilitate and widen therapeutic research in late-life
	dementia. Routine MRI including direct assessment of intracranial
	dynamics should be increasingly used to define etiological subtypes
	of the '' Alzheimer syndrome'' and develop a well-targeted therapeutic
	strategy. }},

	the number of extrinsic fibres linking these regions are both large.
	As with any complex system, systematic analysis is required to draw
	reliable conclusions about the organization of the complex neural
	networks comprising these numerous elements. One aspect of organization
	that has long been suspected is that cortical networks are organized
	into 'streams' or 'systems'. Here we report computational analyses
	capable of showing whether clusters of strongly interconnected areas
	are aspects of the global organization of cortical systems in macaque
	and cat. We used two different approaches to analyse compilations
	of corticocortical connection data from the macaque and the cat.
	The first approach, optimal set analysis, employed an explicit definition
	of a neural 'system' or 'stream', which was based on differential
	connectivity. We defined a two-component cost function that described
	the cost of the global cluster arrangement of areas in terms of the
	areas' connectivity within and between candidate clusters. Optimal
	cluster arrangements of cortical areas were then selected computationally
	from the very many possible arrangements, using an evolutionary optimization
	algorithm. The second approach, non-parametric cluster analysis (NPCA),
	grouped cortical areas on the basis of their proximity in multidimensional
	scaling representations. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling
	to represent the cortical connectivity structures metrically in two
	and five dimensions. NPCA then analysed these representations to
	determine the nature of the clusters for a wide range of different
	cluster shape parameters. The results from both approaches largely
	agreed. They showed that macaque and cat cortices are organized into
	densely intra-connected clusters of areas, and identified the constituent
	members of the clusters. These clusters reflected functionally specialized
	sets of cortical areas, suggesting that structure and function are
	closely linked at this gross, systems level.}},

	should be interpreted with some reserve, and further analysis of
	the algorithmic reliability of the components is needed. Moreover,
	as with any statistical method, the results are affected by the random

	many times with slightly different conditions and visualizing the
	clustering structure of the obtained components in the signal space.
	In experiments with magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and functional

	Also, a computationally efficient method for generating a random

	these techniques, thresholds have been determined for a large variety

	of statistics). By means of interpolation techniques, thresholds
	for additional arbitrary settings can be quickly derived without
	the need to run individual simulations. Compared to the parametric
	approach of Worsley et al. (1996) (Worsley, K.J., Marrett, S., Neelin
	P., Vandal, A.C., Friston, K.J., Evans, A.C., 1996. A unified statistical

	with fields of moderate smoothness (i.e., with a relative full width

	sensitivity is illustrated by the analysis of an actual event related
	functional magnetic resonance data set, and its limitations are tested
	by determining the false positive rate with experimental MR noise

  abstract = {{To understand the effects of a cortical lesion it is necessary to
	consider not only the loss of local neural function, but also the
	lesion-induced changes in the larger network of endogenous oscillatory
	interactions in the brain. To investigate how network embedding influences
	a region's functional role, and the consequences of its being damaged,
	we implement two models of oscillatory cortical interactions, both
	of which inherit their coupling architecture from the available anatomical
	connection data for macaque cerebral cortex. In the first model,
	node dynamics are governed by Kuramoto phase oscillator equations,
	and we investigate the sequence in which areas entrain one another
	in the transition to global synchrony. In the second model, node
	dynamics are governed by a more realistic neural mass model, and
	we assess long-run inter-regional interactions using a measure of
	directed information flow. Highly connected parietal and frontal
	areas are found to synchronize most rapidly, more so than equally
	highly connected visual and somatosensory areas, and this difference
	can be explained in terms of the network's clustered architecture.
	For both models, lesion effects extend beyond the immediate neighbors
	of the lesioned site, and the amplitude and dispersal of nonlocal
	effects are again influenced by cluster patterns in the network.
	Although the consequences of in vivo lesions will always depend on
	circuitry local to the damaged site, we conclude that lesions of
	parietal regions (especially areas 5 and 7a) and frontal regions
	(especially areas 46 and FEF) have the greatest potential to disrupt
	the integrative aspects of neocortical function.}},

	using functional MRI (fMRI), is temporally coherent across 2 populations,
	those populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional
	connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural
	(anatomical) connectivity patterns at an aggregate level. In the
	present study we investigate, with the aid of computational modeling,
	whether systems-level properties of functional networks---including
	their spatial statistics and their persistence across time---can
	be accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network.
	We measured resting state functional connectivity (using fMRI) and
	structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography)
	in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity
	then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics.
	In both model and data, we observed (i) that strong functional connections
	commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection,
	rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional
	connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and interregional
	distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity
	that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (iii)
	that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within

	Twenty-six healthy controls and 29 patients with schizophrenia or

	The application of computational models and techniques to the inherently

	has proven useful for interpreting these data sets and for providing
	predictions and hypotheses for further experiments. We suggest that
	both theory- and data-driven computational modeling of neuronal systems
	can help to interpret data generated by functional neuroimaging methods,
	especially those used with human subjects. In this article, we point
	out four sets of questions, addressable by computational neuroscientists
	whose answere would be of value and interest to those who perform
	functional neuroimaging. The first set consist of determining the
	neurobiological substrate of the signals measured by functional neuroimaging.
	The second set concerns developing systems-level models of functional
	neuroimaging data. The third set of questions involves integrating
	functional neuroimaging data across modalities, with a particular
	emphasis on relating electromagnetic with hemodynamic data. The last
	set asks how one can relate systems-level models to those at the
	neuronal and neural ensemble levels. We feel that there are ample
	reasons to link functional neuroimaging and neural modeling, and
	that combining the results from the two disciplines will result in
	furthering our understanding of the central nervous system. {\copyright}

	anatomical connections, scan-to-scan changes in the level of attention,
	and trial-to-trial interactions with non-specific neurons processing
	noise stimuli. We find that time-series correlations between integrated
	synaptic activities between the anterior temporal and the prefrontal
	cortex were larger during the DMS task than during a control task.
	These results were less clear when the integrated synaptic activity
	was haemodynamically convolved to generate simulated fMRI activity.
	As the strength of the model anatomical connectivity between temporal

	data analysis, statistical parametric mapping (SPM), is based on
	the general linear model (GLM). SPM therefore requires a priori knowledge
	or specific assumptions about the time courses contributing to signal
	changes. In contradistinction, independent component analysis (ICA)
	is a data-driven method based on the assumption that the causes of
	responses are statistically independent. Here we describe a unified
	method, which combines ICA, temporal ICA (tICA), and SPM for analyzing
	fMRI data. tICA was applied to fMRI datasets to disclose independent
	components, whose number was determined by the Bayesian information
	criterion (BIC). The resulting components were used to construct
	the design matrix of a GLM. Parameters were estimated and regionally-specific
	statistical inferences were made about activations in the usual way.
	The sensitivity and specificity were evaluated using Monte Carlo
	simulations. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicated
	that the unified SPM-ICA method had a better performance. Moreover,
	SPM-ICA was applied to fMRI datasets from twelve normal subjects
	performing left and right hand movements. The areas identified corresponded
	to motor (premotor, sensorimotor areas and SMA) areas and were consistently
	task related. Part of the frontal lobe, parietal cortex, and cingulate
	gyrus also showed transiently task-related responses. The unified
	method requires less supervision than the conventional SPM and enables
	classical inference about the expression of independent components.
	Our results also suggest that the method has a higher sensitivity

	functional connectivity within the temporal lobe especially between
	the area around hippocampus and other regions and increase in the
	amount of connectivity within the frontal lobe as well as between
	the parietal and occipital lobes. Also, AD shows weaker between-lobe
	connectivity than within-lobe connectivity and weaker between-hemisphere
	connectivity, compared with NC. In addition to being a method for

	framework for simultaneously learning the contribution of each process
	to the observed data, as well as the timing and identities of each
	instantiated process. They also provide a framework for evaluating
	and selecting among competing models that assume different numbers
	and types of underlying mental processes. We describe the HPM framework
	and its learning and inference algorithms, and present experimental
	results demonstrating its use on simulated and real fMRI data. Our

	of brain organization requires a hierarchy of networks rather than
	the single, binary networks that are currently in vogue. Pattern

	into the sequence of pathologic events in Alzheimer's disease, and
	the clinical features associated with this sequence. We measured
	change in amyloid deposition over time using serial (11)C Pittsburgh
	compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography and progression of
	neurodegeneration using serial structural magnetic resonance imaging.
	We studied 21 healthy cognitively normal subjects, 32 with amnestic
	mild cognitive impairment and 8 with Alzheimer's disease. Subjects
	were drawn from two sources--ongoing longitudinal registries at Mayo
	Clinic, and the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
	All subjects underwent clinical assessments, MRI and PIB studies
	at two time points, approximately one year apart. PIB retention was
	quantified in global cortical to cerebellar ratio units and brain
	atrophy in units of cm(3) by measuring ventricular expansion. The
	annual change in global PIB retention did not differ by clinical
	group (P = 0.90), and although small (median 0.042 ratio units/year
	overall) was greater than zero among all subjects (P < 0.001). Ventricular
	expansion rates differed by clinical group (P < 0.001) and increased
	in the following order: cognitively normal (1.3 cm(3)/year) < amnestic
	mild cognitive impairment (2.5 cm(3)/year) < Alzheimer's disease
	(7.7 cm(3)/year). Among all subjects there was no correlation between
	PIB change and concurrent change on CDR-SB (r = -0.01, P = 0.97)
	but some evidence of a weak correlation with MMSE (r =-0.22, P =
	0.09). In contrast, greater rates of ventricular expansion were clearly
	correlated with worsening concurrent change on CDR-SB (r = 0.42,
	P < 0.01) and MMSE (r =-0.52, P < 0.01). Our data are consistent
	with a model of typical late onset Alzheimer's disease that has two
	main features: (i) dissociation between the rate of amyloid deposition
	and the rate of neurodegeneration late in life, with amyloid deposition
	proceeding at a constant slow rate while neurodegeneration accelerates
	and (ii) clinical symptoms are coupled to neurodegeneration not amyloid
	deposition. Significant plaque deposition occurs prior to clinical
	decline. The presence of brain amyloidosis alone is not sufficient
	to produce cognitive decline, rather, the neurodegenerative component
	of Alzheimer's disease pathology is the direct substrate of cognitive
	impairment and the rate of cognitive decline is driven by the rate
	of neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration (atrophy on MRI) both precedes
	and parallels cognitive decline. This model implies a complimentary
	role for MRI and PIB imaging in Alzheimer's disease, with each reflecting
	one of the major pathologies, amyloid dysmetabolism and neurodegeneration.}},

	accurate classification of fMRI time series according to their activation
	contents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using randomization, the proposed
	method finds wavelet/multiwavelet coefficients that represent the
	activation content of fMRI time series and combines them to define
	new feature spaces. Using simulated and experimental fMRI data sets,
	the proposed feature spaces are compared to the cross-correlation
	(CC) feature space and their performances are evaluated. In these
	studies, the false positive detection rate is controlled using randomization.
	To compare different methods, several points of the receiver operating
	characteristics (ROC) curves, using simulated data, are estimated
	and compared. RESULTS: The proposed features suppress the effects
	of confounding signals and improve activation detection sensitivity.
	Experimental results show improved sensitivity and robustness of
	the proposed method compared to the conventional CC analysis. CONCLUSION:
	More accurate and sensitive activation detection can be achieved
	using the proposed feature spaces compared to CC feature space. Multiwavelet

	formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping, or clustering,
	objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics
	or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that
	tag objects with prior identifiers, i.e., class labels. The absence
	of category information distinguishes data clustering (unsupervised
	learning) from classification or discriminant analysis (supervised
	learning). The aim of clustering is to find structure in data and
	is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich
	history in a variety of scientific fields. One of the most popular

	1955. In spite of the fact that K-means was proposed over 50 years

	group analyses of positron emission tomography data in clinically

	prior to therapy predicts how patients eventually respond to pharmacological

	more informative for clinical decision making if these connectivity

	test such an extension, 46 treatment-na\"{i}ve depressed patients

	to exploratory structural equation modeling (SEM) to derive the optimal

	that group model was highly reproducible, and path weights were consistent
	across the best five group models. When this model was applied to
	data from individual subjects, 85\% of patients fit the group model.
	Histogram analysis of individual subjects' paths indicate that some

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder
	characterized by cognitive and intellectual deficits and behavior
	disturbance. The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used as a tool
	for diagnosing AD for several decades. The hallmark of EEG abnormalities
	in AD patients is a shift of the power spectrum to lower frequencies
	and a decrease in coherence of fast rhythms. These abnormalities
	are thought to be associated with functional disconnections among
	cortical areas resulting from death of cortical neurons, axonal pathology,
	cholinergic deficits, etc. This article reviews main findings of
	EEG abnormalities in AD patients obtained from conventional spectral
	analysis and nonlinear dynamical methods. In particular, nonlinear
	alterations in the EEG of AD patients, i.e. a decreased complexity
	of EEG patterns and reduced information transmission among cortical
	areas, and their clinical implications are discussed. For future
	studies, improvement of the accuracy of differential diagnosis and
	early detection of AD based on multimodal approaches, longitudinal
	studies on nonlinear dynamics of the EEG, drug effects on the EEG
	dynamics, and linear and nonlinear functional connectivity among
	cortical regions in AD are proposed to be investigated. EEG abnormalities
	of AD patients are characterized by slowed mean frequency, less complex
	activity, and reduced coherences among cortical regions. These abnormalities
	suggest that the EEG has utility as a valuable tool for differential
	and early diagnosis of AD.},

  abstract = {{Subject motion present during the time course of functional activation
	studies is a pervasive problem in mapping the spatial and temporal
	characteristics of brain activity. In functional MRI (fMRI) studies,
	the observed signal changes are small. Therefore, it is crucial to
	reduce the effect of subject motion during the acquisition of image
	data in order to differentiate true brain activation from artifactual
	signal changes due to subject motion. We have adapted a technique
	for automatic motion detection and correction which is based on the
	ratio-variance minimization algorithm to the fMRI subject motion
	problem. This method was used for retrospective correction of subject
	motion in the acquired data and resulted in improved functional maps.
	In this paper we have designed and applied a series of tests to evaluate
	the performance of this technique which span the classes of image
	characteristics common to fMRI. These areas include tests of the
	accuracy and range of motion as well as measurement of the effect
	of image signal to noise ratio, focal activation, image resolution,
	and image coverage on the motion detection system. Also, we have
	evaluated the amount of residual motion remaining after motion correction,
	and the ability of this technique to reduce the motion-induced artifacts
	and restore regions of activation lost due to subject motion. In
	summary, this method performed well in the range of image characteristics
	common for fMRI experiments, reducing motion to under 0.5 mm, and
	removed significant motion-induced artifacts while restoring true
	regions of activation. Motion correction is expected to become a
	routine requirement in the analysis of fMRI experiments. {\copyright}

  abstract = {Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia
	(accounting for 60\% to 80\%) and is the fifth leading cause of death
	for those people who are 65 or older. By 2050, one new case of AD
	in United States is expected to develop every 33 sec. Unfortunately,
	there is no available effective treatment that can stop or slow the
	death of neurons that causes AD symptoms. On the other hand, it is
	widely believed that AD starts before development of the associated
	symptoms, so its prestages, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
	or even significant memory concern (SMC), have received increasing
	attention, not only because of their potential as a precursor of
	AD, but also as a possible predictor of conversion to other neurodegenerative
	diseases. Although these prestages have been defined clinically,
	accurate/efficient diagnosis is still challenging. Moreover, brain
	functional abnormalities behind those alterations and conversions
	are still unclear. In this article, by developing novel sparse representations
	of whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
	signals and by using the most updated Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
	Initiative (ADNI) dataset, we successfully identified multiple functional
	components simultaneously, and which potentially represent those
	intrinsic functional networks involved in the resting-state activities.
	Interestingly, these identified functional components contain all
	the resting-state networks obtained from traditional independent-component
	analysis. Moreover, by using the features derived from those functional
	components, it yields high classification accuracy for both AD (94\%)
	and MCI (92\%) versus normal controls. Even for SMC we can still

  abstract = {Recently, brain connectivity networks have been used for classification
	of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from normal
	controls (NC). In typical connectivity-networks-based classification
	approaches, local measures of connectivity networks are first extracted
	from each region-of-interest as network features, which are then
	concatenated into a vector for subsequent feature selection and classification.
	However, some useful structural information of network, especially
	global topological information, may be lost in this type of approaches.
	To address this issue, in this article, we propose a connectivity-networks-based
	classification framework to identify accurately the MCI patients
	from NC. The core of the proposed method involves the use of a new
	graph-kernel-based approach to measure directly the topological similarity
	between connectivity networks. We evaluate our method on functional
	connectivity networks of 12 MCI and 25 NC subjects. The experimental
	results show that our proposed method achieves a classification accuracy
	of 91.9%, a sensitivity of 100.0%, a balanced accuracy of 94.0%,
	and an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94,
	demonstrating a great potential in MCI classification, based on connectivity
	networks. Further connectivity analysis indicates that the connectivity
	of the selected brain regions is different between MCI patients and
	NC, that is, MCI patients show reduced functional connectivity compared
	with NC, in line with the findings reported in the existing studies.

	be caused by defects in the receive coil array or the RF amplifiers
	powering it. During a scan, this artifact results in small image
	intensity shifts in parts of the brain imaged by the affected array
	components. These shifts introduce artifactual correlations in RS
	time series on the spatial scale of the coil's sensitivity profile,
	and can markedly bias RS connectivity results. We show that such
	a transient artifact can be substantially removed from RS time series
	by using locally formed regressors from white matter tissue. This
	is particularly important in arrays with larger numbers of coils,
	which may generate smaller artifact zones. In such a case, brain-wide
	average noise estimates would fail to capture the artifact. We also
	examine the anatomical structure of artifactual variance in RS FMRI
	time series, by identifying sources that contribute to these signals
	and where in the brain are they manifested. We consider current methods
	for reducing confounding sources (or noises) and their effects on
	connectivity maps, and offer an improved approach (ANATICOR) that
	can also reduce hardware artifacts. The methods described herein

  abstract = {{10.1148/radiol.2343040197 PURPOSE: To prospectively determine if
	pulsed arterial spin-labeling perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging
	depicts regional cerebral hypoperfusion in subjects with Alzheimer
	disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), compared with perfusion
	in cognitively normal (CN) subjects, that is consistent with results
	of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and
	hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) single photon emission computed
	tomography (SPECT) studies of similar populations.MATERIALS AND METHODS:
	Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained.
	Twenty subjects with AD (13 men, seven women; mean age, 72.9 years),
	18 with MCI (nine men, nine women; mean age, 73.3 years), and 23
	CN subjects (10 men, 13 women; mean age, 72.9 years) underwent arterial
	spin-labeling and volumetric T1-weighted structural MR imaging. Perfusion
	images were coregistered to structural images, corrected for partial
	volume effects (PVEs) with information from the structural image
	to determine tissue content of perfusion voxels, and normalized to
	a study-specific template. Analyses of perfusion differences between
	groups, with and without corrections for PVEs, were performed on
	a voxel-by-voxel basis with a one-tailed fixed-effects analysis of
	covariance model adjusted for age. In addition, tests were performed
	with and without accounting for global perfusion.RESULTS: The AD
	group showed significant regional hypoperfusion, compared with the
	CN group, in the right inferior parietal cortex extending into the
	bilateral posterior cingulate gyri (P < .001), bilateral superior
	and middle frontal gyri (P < .001), and left inferior parietal lobe
	(P = .007). When PVEs from underlying cortical gray matter atrophy
	were accounted for, the AD group still showed hypoperfusion in the
	right inferior parietal lobe extending into the bilateral posterior
	cingulate gyri (P < .001) and left (P = .003) and right (P = .012)
	middle frontal gyri. With a more liberal voxel-level threshold of
	P < .01, the MCI group showed significant regional hypoperfusion
	relative to the CN group in the inferior right parietal lobe (P =
	.046), similar to the region of greatest significance in the AD group.CONCLUSION:
	Arterial spin-labeling MR imaging showed regional hypoperfusion with
	AD, in brain regions similar to those seen in FDG PET and HMPAO SPECT
	studies of similar populations; this hypoperfusion persists after
	accounting for underlying cortical gray matter atrophy.{\copyright}

	adults (19--25 years; N = 29), without a priori restrictions to specific
	regions. We found similar patterns of functionally connected regions

	of functionally connected regions (i.e., the number of voxels), as
	well as in the strength of functional connectivity (i.e., the correlation
	value) between brain regions. This indicates that functional connectivity
	continues to change during adolescence. Developmental differences
	were found across the whole brain, but the effects differed for functional
	connectivity patterns associated with higher cognitive or emotional

	visual and sensorimotor functions. Finally, we showed that the majority

	on the timing of the image acquisition relative to the heart beat,
	but do not account for the effects of subject motion. Such motion
	affects the fluctuation amplitude, yet volume registration can distort
	the timing information. In this study, we aimed to systematically
	determine the optimal order of volume registration, slice-time correction
	and RETROICOR in their traditional forms. In addition, we evaluate
	the sensitivity of RETROICOR to timing errors introduced by the slice
	acquisition, and we develop a new method of accounting for timing
	errors introduced by volume registration into physiological correction
	(motion-modified RETROICOR). Both simulation and resting data indicate
	that the temporal standard deviation is reduced most by performing
	volume registration before RETROICOR and slice-time correction after
	RETROCIOR. While simulations indicate that physiological noise correction
	with regressors constructed on a slice-by-slice basis more accurately
	modeled physiological noise compared to using the same regressors
	for the entire volume, the difference between these regression techniques
	in subject data was minimal. The motion-modified RETROICOR showed
	marked improvement in simulations with varying amounts of subject
	motion, reducing the temporal standard deviation by up to 36\% over

	studies depending on the importance of detection power or estimation
	efficiency. The extent of vascular contribution to variability in
	block and event-related fMRI-BOLD response is not known. With scaling,
	the extent of vascular variability in the fMRI-BOLD response during
	block and event-related design tasks was investigated. Blood oxygen
	level-dependent (BOLD) contrast data from healthy volunteers performing
	a block design motor task and an event-related memory task requiring
	performance of a motor response were analyzed from the regions of
	interest (ROIs) surrounding the primary and supplementary motor cortices.
	Average BOLD signal change was significantly larger during the block
	design compared to the event-related design. In each subject, BOLD
	signal change across voxels in the ROIs had higher variation during
	the block design task compared to the event-related design task.
	Scaling using the resting state fluctuation of amplitude (RSFA) and
	breath-hold (BH), which minimizes BOLD variation due to vascular
	origins, reduced the within-subject BOLD variability in every subject
	during both tasks but significantly reduced BOLD variability across
	subjects only during the block design task. The strong non-neural
	source of intra- and intersubject variability of BOLD response during
	the block design compared to event-related task indicates that study
	designs optimizing for statistical power through enhancement of the
	BOLD contrast (for, e.g., block design) can be affected by enhancement
	of non-neural sources of BOLD variability.}},

	in larger area of activation (enhancement), suggesting a switch in
	M1 processing mode within the first session (fast learning). By week
	4 of training, concurrent with asymptotic performance, the extent
	of cortex activated by the practised sequence enlarged compared with
	the unpractised sequence, irrespective of order (slow learning).

	over a few weeks of training. These gains did not generalize to the

	movements, suggesting that a lateralized representation of the learned
	sequence of movements evolved through practice. This interpretation
	was supported by functional MRI data showing that a more extensive
	representation of the trained sequence emerged in primary motor cortex
	after 3 weeks of training. The imaging data, however, also indicated
	important changes occurring in primary motor cortex during the initial
	scanning sessions, which we proposed may reflect the setting up of
	a task-specific motor processing routine. Here we provide behavioral
	and functional MRI data on experience-dependent changes induced by
	a limited amount of repetitions within the first imaging session.
	We show that this limited training experience can be sufficient to
	trigger performance gains that require time to become evident. We
	propose that skilled motor performance is acquired in several stages:
	'' fast'' learning, an initial, within-session improvement phase,
	followed by a period of consolidation of several hours duration,
	and then '' slow'' learning, consisting of delayed, incremental gains

	be made if the individual profile of pattern expression could be
	linked to the specific diagnosis of each subject. The result was
	that 90\% of the subjects were correctly classified by the eigenimage,
	and the Jackknife approach revealed well above chance accuracy. The
	pattern of the eigenimage was characterized by positive loadings
	indicating gray matter decline in the patients in the lateral and
	medial prefrontal regions, insula, lateral temporal regions, medial
	temporal structures, and thalamus as well as the negative loadings
	reflecting gray matter increase in the patients in the putamen and
	cerebellum. When the eigenimage derived from the original cohort
	was applied to classify data from the second cohort, it correctly
	assigned more than 80\% of the healthy subjects and schizophrenia
	patients. These findings suggest that the characteristic distribution

	by iFC and those delineated using a variety of other neuroimaging
	techniques, suggests a fundamental brain architecture detectable
	across multiple functional and structural imaging modalities. Here,
	we leverage this insight to examine the functional organization of
	the human insula. We parcellated the insula on the basis of three
	distinct neuroimaging modalities --- task-evoked coactivation, intrinsic
	(i.e., task-independent) functional connectivity, and gray matter
	structural covariance. Clustering of these three different covariance-based
	measures revealed a convergent elemental organization of the insula
	that likely reflects a fundamental brain architecture governing both
	brain structure and function at multiple spatial scales. While not
	constrained to be hierarchical, our parcellation revealed a pseudo-hierarchical,
	multiscale organization that was consistent with previous clustering
	and meta-analytic studies of the insula. Finally, meta-analytic examination
	of the cognitive and behavioral domains associated with each of the
	insular clusters obtained elucidated the broad functional dissociations
	likely underlying the topography observed. To facilitate future investigations
	of insula function across healthy and pathological states, the insular
	parcels have been made freely available for download via http://fcon\_1000.projects.nitrc.org,
	along with the analytic scripts used to perform the parcellations.

	of interest (ROIs) previously shown to elicit networks known to be
	associated with motivational, cognitive and motor subdivisions of
	the caudate and putamen (Di Martino et al., 2008). In addition to

	ventral striatal and dorsal caudate FC with the default mode network.
	These alterations in FC are consistent with studies that have demonstrated

  abstract = {{Growing interest in pharmacological resting state fMRI (RSfMRI) necessitates
	developing standardized and robust analytical approaches that are
	insensitive to spurious correlated physiological signals. However,
	in pharmacological experiments physiological variations constitute
	an important aspect of the pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic profile
	of drug action; therefore retrospective corrective methods that discard
	physiological signals as noise may not be suitable. Previously, we
	have shown that template-based dual regression analysis is a sensitive
	method for model-free and objective detection of drug-specific effects
	on functional brain connectivity. In the current study, the robustness
	of this standard approach to physiological variations in a placebo
	controlled, repeated measures pharmacological RSfMRI study of morphine
	and alcohol in 12 healthy young men is tested. The impact of physiology-related
	variations on statistical inferences has been studied by: 1) modeling
	average physiological rates in higher level group analysis; 2) Regressing
	out the instantaneous respiration variation (RV); 3) applying retrospective
	image correction (RETROICOR) in the preprocessing stage; and 4) performing
	combined RV and heart rate correction (RVHRCOR) by regressing out
	physiological pulses convolved with canonical respiratory and cardiac
	hemodynamic response functions. Results indicate regional sensitivity
	of the BOLD signal to physiological variations, especially in the
	vicinity of large vessels, plus certain brain structures that are
	reported to be involved in physiological regulation, such as posterior
	cingulate, precuneus, medial prefrontal and insular cortices, as
	well as the thalamus, cerebellum and the brainstem. The largest impact
	of '' correction'' on final statistical test outcomes resulted from
	including the average respiration frequency and heart rate in the
	higher-level group analysis. Overall, the template-based dual regression
	method seems robust against physical noise that is corrected by RV
	regression or RETROICOR. However, convolving the RV and HR with canonical
	hemodynamic response functions caused a notable change in the BOLD
	signal variance, and in resting state connectivity estimates. The
	impact of RVHRCOR on statistical tests was limited to elimination
	of both morphine and alcohol effects related to the somatosensory
	network that consists of insula and cingulate cortex---important
	structures for autonomic regulation. Although our data do not warrant
	speculations about neuronal or vascular origins of these effects,
	these observations raise caution about the implications of physiological
	'noise' and the risks of introducing false positives (e.g. increased
	white matter connectivity) by using generalized physiological correction
	methods in pharmacological studies. The obvious sensitivity of the
	posterior part of the default mode network to different correction
	schemes, underlines the importance of controlling for physiological

	initial cluster centers are selected randomly. In this paper we propose
	an algorithm to compute initial cluster centers for K-means clustering.
	This algorithm is based on two observations that some of the patterns
	are very similar to each other and that is why they have same cluster
	membership irrespective to the choice of initial cluster centers.
	Also, an individual attribute may provide some information about
	initial cluster center. The initial cluster centers computed using
	this methodology are found to be very close to the desired cluster
	centers, for iterative clustering algorithms. This procedure is applicable
	to clustering algorithms for continuous data. We demonstrate the
	application of proposed algorithm to K-means clustering algorithm.
	The experimental results show improved and consistent solutions using

  abstract = {{Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) of functional magnetic resonance imaging
	(fMRI) data allows one to make inferences about the architecture
	of distributed networks in the brain, in terms of effective connectivity.
	fMRI data are usually acquired using echo planar imaging (EPI). EPI
	sequences typically acquire slices at different times over a few
	seconds. DCM, in its original inception, was not informed about these
	slice timings and assumed that all slices were acquired simultaneously.
	It has been shown that DCM can cope with slice timing differences
	of up to 1 s. However, many fMRI studies employ a repetition time
	(TR) of 3 to 5[no-break space]s, which precludes a straightforward
	DCM of these data.We show that this limitation can be overcome easily
	by including slice timing in the DCM. Using synthetic data we show
	that the extended DCM furnishes veridical posterior means, even if
	there are large slice-timing differences. Model comparisons show
	that, in general, the extended DCM out-performs the original model.
	We contrast the modeling of slice timing, in the context of DCM,
	with the less effective approach of `slice-timing correction', prior
	to modeling. We apply our procedure to real data and show that slice
	timings are important parameters. We conclude that, generally, one
	should use DCM with slice timing.}},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Discrete focal lesions in the splenium of
	the corpus callosum on MR images in epileptic patients have received
	little attention in the literature. Our purpose was to describe these
	lesions, which may be related to the toxicity of antiepileptic drugs
	(AEDs), and to discuss the possible mechanisms of their development.
	METHODS: We examined six patients with epilepsy whose brain MR imaging
	findings showed a discrete focal nonhemorrhagic lesion in the splenium
	of the corpus callosum. The medical records and MR images were reviewed
	retrospectively with respect to the patients' clinical history, medication,
	and laboratory findings to determine the etiology of the lesion.
	RESULTS: In all six patients MR imaging showed a focal lesion in
	the splenium of the corpus callosum, which was ovoid in shape and
	15 to 19 mm in size. In the three patients who received contrast
	material, there was no enhancement of the lesion. Four of six patients
	had a history of medication with dilantin, in two of whom the level
	of serum dilantin was found to be elevated (22.3 {micro}g/mL and
	70.4 {micro}g/mL, respectively). Vigabatrin was administered in three
	patients, one of whom took dilantin together with vigabatrin. In
	two patients, the focal lesion in the corpus callosum disappeared
	on follow-up MR images after withdrawal of dilantin and/or vigabatrin.
	CONCLUSION: A discrete, focal, ovoid, nonhemorrhagic lesion in the
	splenium of the corpus callosum may be seen on brain MR images of
	patients with epilepsy. The lesion is considered to be reversible
	demyelination related to AEDs toxicity.},

	growing research topics in neuroimaging. It has been shown that up
	to 12 RSNs can be differentiated using an independent component analysis
	(ICA) of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) resting state data.
	In this study, we investigate how many RSN signal sources can be
	separated from the entire brain cortex using high dimension ICA analysis
	from a group dataset. Group data from 55 subjects was analyzed using
	temporal concatenation and a probabilistic independent component
	analysis algorithm. ICA repeatability testing verified that 60 of
	the 70 computed components were robustly detectable. Forty-two independent
	signal sources were identifiable as RSN, and 28 were related to artifacts
	or other noninterest sources (non-RSN). The depicted RSNs bore a
	closer match to functional neuroanatomy than the previously reported
	RSN components. The non-RSN sources have significantly lower temporal

	precedes the clinical manifestation of the disease in aged individuals.
	The active Caspase-6 is localized in neuritic plaques, in neuropil
	threads, and in neurofibrillary tangles containing neurons that are
	not morphologically apoptotic in nature. To investigate the potential
	consequences of the activation of Caspase-6 in neurons, we conducted
	a proteomics analysis of Caspase-6-mediated cleavage of human neuronal
	proteins. Proteins from the cytosolic and membrane subcellular compartments
	were treated with recombinant active Caspase-6 and compared with
	undigested proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. LC/MS/MS
	analyses of the proteins that were cleaved identified 24 different
	potential protein substrates. Of these, 40\% were cytoskeleton or
	cytoskeleton-associated proteins. We focused on the cytoskeleton
	proteins because these are critical for neuronal structure and function.
	Caspase-6 cleavage of alpha-Tubulin, alpha-Actinin-4, Spinophilin,
	and Drebrin was confirmed. At least one Caspase-6 cleavage site was
	identified for Drebrin, Spinophilin, and alpha-Tubulin. A neoepitope
	antiserum to alpha-Tubulin cleaved by Caspase-6 immunostained neurons,
	neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, and neuritic plaques in
	Alzheimer disease and co-localized with active Caspase-6. These results
	imply that the early and neuritic activation of Caspase-6 in Alzheimer
	disease could disrupt the cytoskeleton network of neurons, resulting
	in impaired neuronal structure and function in the absence of cell
	death. This study provides novel insights into the pathophysiology
	of Alzheimer disease.}},

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Vascular factors are recognized as important risk factors
	for Alzheimer's disease, although it is unknown whether these factors
	directly lead to the typical degenerative pathology such as medial
	temporal lobe atrophy. We set out to investigate the relation between
	blood pressure and medial temporal lobe atrophy in patients with
	senile and presenile Alzheimer's disease with or without white matter
	lesions. METHODS: We determined the relation between blood pressure
	and pulse pressure and medial temporal lobe atrophy on MRI in 159
	patients with Alzheimer's disease, stratified on white matter lesions
	and age at onset of dementia. RESULTS: There was a linear relation
	between systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure (both in tertiles)
	and the severity of medial temporal lobe atrophy (p(trend) = 0.05
	and p(trend) 0.03, respectively). A significant relation was found
	between pulse pressure [beta = 0.08 (95\% CI: 0.00-0.15; p = 0.05)
	per 10 mm Hg] and (borderline significant) systolic blood pressure
	[beta = 0.05 (95\% CI: -0.01 to 0.11; p = 0.1) per 10 mm Hg] and
	medial temporal lobe atrophy. White matter lesions and age-stratified
	analysis revealed a significant association between systolic blood
	pressure and pulse pressure and medial temporal lobe atrophy, only
	in the subsample with white matter lesions and in the subsample with
	a senile onset of dementia. The relations were independent of severity
	of dementia and diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: Systolic blood pressure
	and pulse pressure are associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy
	in Alzheimer's disease, especially in the presence of white matter
	lesions and in patients with a late onset of dementia. Our finding
	may be another step in providing a rationale on how vascular factors
	could ultimately result in Alzheimer's disease.}},

	these possibilities in a small number of patients, wider application
	has been limited by concerns about patient safety, severe problems
	due to pulse-related artefact obscuring the EEG trace, and lack of
	reproducibility data. We have systematically studied and resolved
	the issues of patient safety and pulse artefact and now report the
	application of the technique in 24 experiments in 10 consecutive
	patients with localization-related epilepsy and frequent interictal
	epileptiform discharges (spikes or spike wave). At least two experiments
	were performed for each patient. In each experiment, 10- or 20-slice

	a single typical epileptiform discharge (activation image) and in

  abstract = {{A central challenge in the fMRI based study of functional connectivity
	is distinguishing neuronally related signal fluctuations from the
	effects of motion, physiology, and other nuisance sources. Conventional
	techniques for removing nuisance effects include modeling of noise
	time courses based on external measurements followed by temporal
	filtering. These techniques have limited effectiveness. Previous
	studies have shown using multi-echo fMRI that neuronally related
	fluctuations are Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signals that
	can be characterized in terms of changes in R2* and initial signal
	intensity (S0) based on the analysis of echo-time (TE) dependence.
	We hypothesized that if TE-dependence could be used to differentiate
	BOLD and non-BOLD signals, non-BOLD signal could be removed to denoise
	data without conventional noise modeling. To test this hypothesis,
	whole brain multi-echo data were acquired at 3 TEs and decomposed
	with Independent Components Analysis (ICA) after spatially concatenating
	data across space and TE. Components were analyzed for the degree
	to which their signal changes fit models for R2* and S0 change, and
	summary scores were developed to characterize each component as BOLD-like
	or not BOLD-like. These scores clearly differentiated BOLD-like ''
	functional network'' components from non BOLD-like components related
	to motion, pulsatility, and other nuisance effects. Using non BOLD-like
	component time courses as noise regressors dramatically improved
	seed-based correlation mapping by reducing the effects of high and

	correlation mapping using conventional noise regressors demonstrated
	the superiority of the proposed technique for both individual and

	SKILLED (3.8 Hz) than the NOVEL condition (2.5 Hz) (P < 0.001), but
	there was no difference in execution errors. Activation foci associated
	with execution and imagery was congruent in both the NOVEL and SKILLED
	conditions, though activation features were more similar in the SKILLED
	versus NOVEL phase. In the NOVEL phase, activations were more extensive
	during execution than imagery in primary and secondary cortical motor
	volumes and the cerebellum, while during imagery activations were
	greater in the striatum. In the SKILLED phase, activation features
	within these same volumes became increasingly similar for execution

	inferior parietal lobe, and medial temporal lobe, while execution
	more heavily activated the precentral/postcentral gyri, striatum,

  pages = {962--974},
  number = {2},

  abstract = {{Correlation analysis has been widely used in the study of functional
	connectivity based on fMRI data. It assumes that the relevant information
	about the interactions of brain regions is reflected by a linear
	relationship between the values of two signals at the same time.
	However, this hypothesis has not been thoroughly investigated yet.
	In this work, we study in depth the information shared by BOLD signals
	of pairs of brain regions. In particular, we assess the amount of
	nonlinear and/or nonsynchronous interactions present in data. This
	is achieved by testing models reflecting linear, synchronous interactions
	against more general models, encompassing nonlinear, nonsynchronous
	interactions. Many factors influencing measured BOLD signals are
	critical for the study of connectivity, such as paradigm-induced
	BOLD responses, preprocessing, motion artifacts, and geometrical
	distortions. Interactions are also influenced by the proximity of
	brain regions. The influence of all these factors is taken into account
	and the nature of the interactions is studied using various experimental
	conditions such that the conclusions reached are robust with respect
	to variation of these factors. After defining nonlinear and/or nonsynchronous
	interaction models in the framework of general linear models, statistical
	tests are performed on different fMRI data sets to infer the nature
	of the interactions. Finally, a new connectivity metric is proposed
	which takes these inferences into account. We find that BOLD signal
	interactions are statistically more significant when taking into
	account the history of the distant signal, i.e., the signal from
	the interacting region, than when using a model of linear instantaneous
	interaction. Moreover, about 75\% of the interactions are symmetric,
	as assessed with the proposed connectivity metric. The history-dependent
	part of the coupling between brain regions can explain a high percentage
	of the variance in the data sets studied. As these results are robust
	with respect to various confounding factors, this work suggests that
	models used to study the functional connectivity between brain areas
	should in general take the BOLD signal history into account.}},

	properties for dependent data, covering a wide range of topics such
	as block bootstrap methods, bootstrap methods in the frequency domain,
	resampling methods for long range dependent data, and resampling
	methods for spatial data. The first five chapters of the book treat
	the theory and applications of block bootstrap methods at the level
	of a graduate text. The rest of the book is written as a research
	monograph, with frequent references to the literature, but mostly
	at a level accessible to graduate students familiar with basic concepts
	in statistics. Supplemental background material is added in the discussion
	of such important issues as second order properties of bootstrap
	methods, bootstrap under long range dependence, and bootstrap for
	extremes and heavy tailed dependent data. Further, illustrative numerical
	examples are given all through the book and issues involving application
	of the methodology are discussed. The book fills a gap in the literature
	covering research on resampling methods for dependent data that has
	witnessed vigorous growth over the last two decades but remains scattered
	in various statistics and econometrics journals. It can be used as
	a graduate level text for a special topics course on resampling methods
	for dependent data and also as a research monograph for statisticians
	and econometricians who want to learn more about the topic and want
	to apply the methods in their own research. S.N. Lahiri is a professor

  abstract = {{The default mode network (DMN) comprises a set of regions that exhibit
	ongoing, intrinsic activity in the resting state and task-related
	decreases in activity across a range of paradigms. However, DMN regions
	have also been reported as task-related increases, either independently
	or coactivated with other regions in the network. Cognitive subtractions
	and the use of low-level baseline conditions have generally masked
	the functional nature of these regions. Using a combination of activation
	likelihood estimation, which assesses statistically significant convergence
	of neuroimaging results, and tools distributed with the BrainMap
	database, we identified core regions in the DMN and examined their
	functional heterogeneity. Meta-analytic coactivation maps of task-related
	increases were independently generated for each region, which included
	both within-DMN and non-DMN connections. Their functional properties
	were assessed using behavioral domain metadata in BrainMap. These
	results were integrated to determine a DMN connectivity model that
	represents the patterns of interactions observed in task-related
	increases in activity across diverse tasks. Subnetwork components
	of this model were identified, and behavioral domain analysis of
	these cliques yielded discrete functional properties, demonstrating
	that components of the DMN are differentially specialized. Affective
	and perceptual cliques of the DMN were identified, as well as the
	cliques associated with a reduced preference for motor processing.
	In summary, we used advanced coordinate-based meta-analysis techniques
	to explicate behavior and connectivity in the default mode network;
	future work will involve applying this analysis strategy to other
	modes of brain function, such as executive function or sensorimotor
	systems.}},

	cognitive impairment (MCI). The analyses were designed to investigate
	two issues: the relationship of MCI to Alzheimer's disease, and that
	of atypical to typical Alzheimer's disease. When longitudinal data
	were averaged across individual patients, a consistent staging of
	neuropsychological deficits emerged: the selective amnesia characteristic
	of the MCI phase was joined next by semantic and other linguistic
	impairments plus emerging difficulties with demanding visuospatial
	tasks. A two-stage statistical procedure was used to extract underlying
	factors that corresponded to the severity-governed decline in neuropsychological
	test scores and then to the consistent deviations away from this
	typical longitudinal profile; i.e. identifying patterns of atypical
	Alzheimer's disease. The severity-based factor accounted for nearly
	60\% of the variance in this MCI-Alzheimer's disease longitudinal
	and cross-sectional database. This suggests that there is a fairly
	high degree of homogeneity within this group of patients, and that
	most of their longitudinal progression can be predicted by dementia
	severity alone. There were also two main patterns of atypical variation
	corresponding to patients with exaggerated semantic or visuospatial
	deficits. Although such cases may mimic more focal lobar degenerative
	conditions, patients with atypical Alzheimer's disease have pronounced
	episodic memory impairments, suggesting amnesia as a critical diagnostic

	to simulated and actual BOLD fMRI signals and compare their performances
	under each signal type. Starting with baseline time series generated
	by a resting subject during a null hypothesis study, we compare method
	performance with embedded focal activity in these series of three
	different types whose magnitudes and time courses are simple, convolved
	with spatially varying hemodynamic responses, and highly spatially
	interactive. We then apply these same nine methods to BOLD fMRI time
	series from contralateral primary motor cortex and ipsilateral cerebellum
	collected during a sequential finger opposition study. Paired comparisons
	of results across methods include a voxel-specific concordance correlation
	coefficient for reproducibility and a resemblance measure that accommodates
	spatial autocorrelation of differences in activity surfaces. Receiver-operating
	characteristic curves show considerable model differences in ranges
	less than 10\% significance level (false positives) and greater than
	80\% power (true positives). Concordance and resemblance measures
	reveal significant differences between activity surfaces in both
	data sets. These measures can assist researchers by identifying groups
	of models producing similar and dissimilar results, and thereby help
	to validate, consolidate, and simplify reports of statistical findings.
	A pluralistic strategy for fMRI data analysis can uncover invariant
	and highly interactive relationships between local activity foci
	and serve as a basis for further discovery of organizational principles
	of the brain. Results also suggest that a pluralistic empirical strategy
	coupled formally with substantive prior knowledge can help to uncover
	new brain-behavior relationships that may remain hidden if only a
	single method is employed.}},

  abstract = {{In this study, the application of factor analytic (FA) rotation methods
	in the context of neuroimaging data analysis was explored. Three
	FA algorithms (ProMax, QuartiMax, and VariMax) were employed to carry
	out blind source separation in a functional magnetic resonance imaging
	(fMRI) experiment that involved a basic audiovisual stimulus paradigm.
	The outcomes were compared with those from three common independent
	component analysis (ICA) methods (FastICA, InfoMax, and Jade). When
	applied in the spatial domain (sFA), all three FA methods performed
	satisfactorily and comparably to the ICA methods. The QuartiMax and
	VariMax methods resulted in highly similar outcomes, while the ProMax
	results more closely resembled those from the FastICA and InfoMax
	ICA analyses. All methods were able to identify multiple distinct
	contributing factors of neural origin, including e.g. the central
	auditory system, the mediotemporal limbic lobe, the basal ganglia,
	and the motor system. In addition, various contributions from artifacts
	could be observed, but these constituted different factors that were
	well separated from those with neural effects. When applied in the
	temporal domain (tFA), the factor analytic methods performed drastically
	worse, in the sense that the spatial activation maps revealed activation
	much more diffusely throughout the brain and the corresponding time
	courses were less pronouncedly related to the employed stimulus paradigm.
	Temporal ICA performed better than tFA, with the possible exception
	of the Jade method, but still did worse than any of the spatial FA
	or ICA methods. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that
	sFA forms a viable and useful alternative to ICA in the context of
	fMRI data analyses, and indicate that sFA methods complement the
	range of blind source separation methods that are currently in use
	in fMRI already.}},

  abstract = {{This report presents and validates a method for the group-level statistical
	assessment of independent component analysis (ICA) outcomes. The
	method is based on a matching of individual component maps to corresponding
	aggregate maps that are obtained from concatenated data. Group-level
	statistics are derived that include an explicit correction for selection
	bias. Outcomes were validated by means of calculations with artificial
	null data. Although statistical inferences were found to be incorrect
	if bias was neglected, the use of the proposed bias correction sufficed
	to obtain valid results. This was further confirmed by extensive
	calculations with artificial data that contained known effects of
	interest. While uncorrected statistical assessments systematically
	violated the imposed confidence level thresholds, the corrected method
	was never observed to exceed the allowed false positive rate. Yet,
	bias correction was found to result in a reduced sensitivity and
	a moderate decrease in discriminatory power. The method was also
	applied to analyze actual fMRI data. Various effects of interest
	that were detectable in the aggregate data were similarly revealed
	by the retrospective matching method. In particular, stimulus-related
	responses were extensive. Nevertheless, differences were observed
	regarding their spatial distribution. The presented findings indicate
	that the proposed method is suitable for neuroimaging analyses. Finally,

  abstract = {{It is difficult to study the brain '' at rest'' with an approach
	generally pursued in science when external manipulation (independent
	variable) is used to obtain informative measurements (dependent variable)
	about the object of interest. External manipulation in its classic
	sense may suspend the resting state, and hence the object of interest
	will evade. Naturally, unless in a final and irreversible state,
	biological rest will always be an endogenously dynamic process. Combining
	two modalities, electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI), to simultaneously measure the brain's activity
	from two angles, one can be chosen to be interpreted as the independent
	variable and the other as the dependent variable, and without external
	manipulation the brain's spontaneous dynamics can be studied. The
	EEG, for example, observes endogenous modulations of vigilance and
	detects spontaneous events such as sleep spindles or epileptic discharges
	and can be used as the independent variable, i.e., to form a regressor
	to interrogate the fMRI data (dependent variable). The opposite is
	possible as well, and data fusion attempts try using all data both
	as dependent and independent variables at the same time. This review
	limits itself to an exemplary discussion of simultaneous EEG/fMRI
	studies in humans, and among a variety of proposed resting state
	networks only discusses a few, especially those for which non-resting
	state literature has proposed a functional meaning: the '' default
	mode'' network and an attentional network. It will be shown that
	one EEG feature can correlate with different fMRI activation maps
	and that a single resting state network may be associated with a
	variety of EEG patterns giving insight into the function of different

	was little positive correlation of localized brain activity with

	in lateral frontal and parietal cortices that are known to support
	attentional processes. Power in a 17--23 Hz range of beta activity

	In this respect, MRI of molecular diffusion is very sensitive to

	First, a modified receiver operating characteristic analysis is described

	highly averaged experimental data acquired with the same stimulation/task.
	Unlike ROC analysis based on simulated activation data, the present
	approach can be applied to experimentally acquired data without simplifying
	the activation related changes. To assess the reliability of fMRI
	studies, the kappa statistic was adopted for evaluating the overall
	agreement of functional activation maps from repeated experiments
	in individual subjects. To demonstrate the utility of these techniques,
	both the ROC analysis and the reliability assessment were applied
	to quantitatively evaluate the improvement in accuracy and reliability

  abstract = {{Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) is a method for estimating and making

	[Friston, K.J., Harrison, L., Penny, W., 2003 Dynamic causal modelling.
	Neuroimage 19, 1273--1302]. Large-scale neural modelling aims to
	construct neurobiologically grounded computational models with emergent
	behaviours that inform our understanding of neuronal systems. One
	such model has been used to simulate region-specific BOLD time-series
	[Horwitz, B., Friston, K.J., Taylor, J.G., 2000. Neural modeling
	and functional brain imaging: an overview. Neural Netw. 13, 829--846].
	DCM was used to make inferences about effective connectivity using
	data generated by a model implementing a visual delayed match-to-sample
	task [Tagamets, M.A., Horwitz, B., 1998. Integrating electrophysiological
	and anatomical experimental data to create a large-scale model that
	simulates a delayed match-to-sample human brain imaging study. Cereb.
	Cortex 8, 310--320]. The aim was to explore the validity of inferences
	made using DCM about the connectivity structure and task-dependent
	modulatory effects, in a system with a known connectivity structure.
	We also examined the effects of misspecifying regions of interest.
	Models with hierarchical connectivity and reciprocal connections
	were examined using DCM and Bayesian Model Comparison [Penny, W.D.,
	Stephan, K.E., Mechelli, A., Friston, K.J., 2004. Comparing dynamic
	causal models. Neuroimage 22, 1157--1172]. This approach revealed
	strong evidence for those models with correctly specified anatomical
	connectivity. Furthermore, Bayesian model comparison favoured those
	models when bilinear effects corresponded to their implementation
	in the neural model. These findings generalised to an extended model
	with two additional areas and reentrant circuits. The conditional
	uncertainty of coupling parameter estimates increased in proportion
	to the number of incorrectly specified regions. These results highlight
	the role of neural models in establishing the validity of estimation
	and inference schemes. Specifically, Bayesian model comparison confirms
	the validity of DCM in relation to a well-characterised and comprehensive
	neuronal model.}},

	The two cluster result found the task-negative and task-positive

	cluster result was associated with either the task-negative or task-positive

	direct comparison with data obtained from functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (fMRI). We obtained the following results. (i) The BLP of
	the local field displayed fluctuations at many time-scales, with
	particularly large amplitude at very low frequencies (<0.1 Hz). (ii)
	These fluctuations exhibited high coherence between electrode pairs,

	(iii) Coherence in the BLP, unlike that in the raw LFP, did not fall
	off sharply as a function of cortical distance. (iv) The structure
	and coherence of BLP changes were highly similar under distinctly
	different behavioral states. These results demonstrate the existence

  abstract = {{10.1093/cercor/bhh200 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by
	a heterogeneous distribution of pathological changes throughout the
	brain. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to investigate the
	regional distribution of cortical atrophy in AD in vivo. One marker
	for the disease-specific atrophy is the thickness of the cortical
	mantle across the brain, obtained with automated 3-D image processing.
	Here, we present data from 36 subjects (17 controls and, 19 patients
	diagnosed as probable AD) investigated for cortical thickness across
	the entire brain. We show significant cortical thickness decline
	in AD in temporal, orbitofrontal and parietal regions, with the most
	pronounced changes occurring in the allocortical region of the medial
	temporal lobes, outlining the parahippocampal gyrus, and representing
	a loss of >1.25 millimeters of cortical thickness. Moreover, focal
	cortical areas decline with progression of the disease as measured
	by time from baseline scan as well as the Mini-Mental State Exam.
	The results demonstrate the ability of this method to detect changes
	in cortical thickness in AD, across the entire brain, without need
	of prior anatomical definitions. The regional distribution of changes
	reported here is consistent with independent findings on the distribution
	of neuropathological alterations in AD. Using cortical thickness,
	moreover, we provide a direct quantitative index of atrophy in the
	disease.}},

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND:With the increasing amount of data generated in molecular
	genetics laboratories, it is often difficult to make sense of results
	because of the vast number of different outcomes or variables studied.
	Examples include expression levels for large numbers of genes and
	haplotypes at large numbers of loci. It is then natural to group
	observations into smaller numbers of classes that allow for an easier
	overview and interpretation of the data. This grouping is often carried
	out in multiple steps with the aid of hierarchical cluster analysis,
	each step leading to a smaller number of classes by combining similar
	observations or classes. At each step, either implicitly or explicitly,
	researchers tend to interpret results and eventually focus on that
	set of classes providing the "best" (most significant) result. While
	this approach makes sense, the overall statistical significance of
	the experiment must include the clustering process, which modifies
	the grouping structure of the data and often removes variation.RESULTS:For
	hierarchically clustered data, we propose considering the strongest
	result or, equivalently, the smallest p-value as the experiment-wise
	statistic of interest and evaluating its significance level for a
	global assessment of statistical significance. We apply our approach
	to datasets from haplotype association and microarray expression
	studies where hierarchical clustering has been used.CONCLUSION:In
	all of the cases we examine, we find that relying on one set of classes
	in the course of clustering leads to significance levels that are
	too small when compared with the significance level associated with
	an overall statistic that incorporates the process of clustering.
	In other words, relying on one step of clustering may furnish a formally
	significant result while the overall experiment is not significant.}},

	stimuli, but actively maintains ongoing representations that may
	be involved in the coding of expected sensory stimuli, prospective
	motor responses, and prior experience. Spontaneous cortical activity
	has been proposed to play an important part in maintaining these
	ongoing, internal representations, although its functional role is
	not well understood. One spontaneous signal being intensely investigated
	in the human brain is the interregional temporal correlation of the
	blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal recorded at rest by functional
	MRI (functional connectivity-by-MRI, fcMRI, or BOLD connectivity).
	This signal is intrinsic and coherent within a number of distributed
	networks whose topography closely resembles that of functional networks
	recruited during tasks. While it is apparent that fcMRI networks
	reflect anatomical connectivity, it is less clear whether they have
	any dynamic functional importance. Here, we demonstrate that visual
	perceptual learning, an example of adult neural plasticity, modifies
	the resting covariance structure of spontaneous activity between
	networks engaged by the task. Specifically, after intense training
	on a shape-identification task constrained to one visual quadrant,
	resting BOLD functional connectivity and directed mutual interaction
	between trained visual cortex and frontal-parietal areas involved
	in the control of spatial attention were significantly modified.
	Critically, these changes correlated with the degree of perceptual
	learning. We conclude that functional connectivity serves a dynamic
	role in brain function, supporting the consolidation of previous

	We apply the proposed method on the simulated data and show that

  abstract = {{A three-dimensional image registration method for motion correction
	of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time-series, based
	on independent component analysis (ICA), is described. We argue that
	movement during fMRI data acquisition results in a simultaneous increase
	in the joint entropy of the observed time-series and a decrease in
	the joint entropy of a nonlinear function of the derived spatially
	independent components calculated by ICA. We propose this entropy
	difference as a reliable criterion for motion correction and refer
	to a method that maximizes this as motion-corrected ICA (MCICA).
	Specifically, a given motion-corrupted volume may be corrected by
	determining the linear combination of spatial transformations of
	the motion-corrupted volume that maximizes the proposed criterion.
	In essence, MCICA consists of designing an adaptive spatial resampling
	filter which maintains maximum temporal independence among the recovered
	components. In contrast with conventional registration methods, MCICA
	does not require registration of motion-corrupted volumes to a single
	reference volume which can introduce artifacts because corrections
	are applied without accounting for variability due to the task-related
	activation. Simulations demonstrate that MCICA is robust to activation
	level, additive noise, random motion in the reference volumes and
	the exact number of independent components extracted. When the method
	was applied to real data with minimal estimated motion, the method
	had little effect and, hence, did not introduce spurious changes
	in the data. However, in a data series from a motor fMRI experiment
	with larger motion, preprocessing the data with the proposed method
	resulted in the emergence of activation in primary motor and supplementary
	motor cortices. Although mutual information (MI) was not explicitly
	optimized, the MI between all subsequent volumes and the first one
	was consistently increased for all volumes after preprocessing the
	data with MCICA. We suggest MCICA represents a robust and reliable
	method for preprocessing of fMRI time-series corrupted with motion.}},

  abstract = {{Task-related head movement during acquisition of fMRI data represents
	a serious confound for both motion correction and estimates of task-related
	activation. Cost functions implemented in most conventional motion-correction
	algorithms compare two volumes for similarity but fail to account
	for signal variability that is not due to motion (e.g., brain activation).
	We therefore recently proposed the theoretical basis for a novel
	method for fMRI motion correction, termed motion-corrected independent
	component analysis (MCICA), that allows for brain activation present
	in an fMRI time-series to be implicitly modeled and mitigates motion-induced
	signal changes without having to directly estimate the motion parameters
	(Liao et al., IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging 2005;25:29-44).
	To explore the effects of non-movement-related signal changes on
	registration error, we performed several previously proposed test
	simulations (Freire et al., IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging
	2002;21:470-484) to evaluate the performance of MCICA and compare
	it with the conventional square-of-difference-based measures such
	as LS-SPM and LS-AIR. We demonstrate that for both simulated data
	and real fMRI images, the proposed MCICA method performs favorably.
	Specifically, in simulations MCICA was more robust to the addition
	of simulated activation, and did not lead to the detection of false
	activations after correction for simulated task-correlated motion.
	With actual data from a motor fMRI experiment, the time course of
	the derived continually task-related ICA component became more correlated
	with the underlying behavioral task after preprocessing with MCICA
	compared to other methods, and the associated activation map was
	more clustered in the primary motor and supplementary motor cortices
	without spurious activation at the brain edge. We conclude that assessing
	the statistical properties of a motion-corrupted volume in relation
	to other volumes in the series, as is done with MCICA, is an accurate
	means of differentiating between motion-induced signal changes and
	other sources of variability in fMRI data.}},

	samples and the spatially correlated nature of multiple RF receivers.
	Regularization has been proposed to mitigate the SNR loss originating
	due to the latter reason. Since it is necessary to utilize static
	prior to regularization, the dynamic contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)
	in parallel MRI will be affected. In this paper we investigate the

	propose to implement regularized parallel MRI acquisitions in functional

	We investigated the impact of regularization on the CNR by performing

  abstract = {{Early visual deprivation can lead to changes in the brain, which
	may be explained by either of two hypotheses. The general loss hypothesis
	has been proposed to explain maladjustments, while the compensatory
	plasticity hypothesis may explain a superior ability in the use of
	the remaining senses. Most previous task-based functional MRI (fMRI)
	studies have supported the compensatory plasticity hypothesis, but
	it has been difficult to provide evidence to support the general
	loss hypothesis, since the blind cannot execute visual tasks. The
	study of resting state fMRI data may provide an opportunity to simultaneously
	detect the two aspects of changes in the blind. In this study, using
	a whole brain perspective, we investigated the decreased and increased
	functional connectivities in the early blind using resting state
	fMRI data. The altered functional connectivities were identified
	by comparing the correlation coefficients of each pair of brain regions
	of 16 early blind subjects (9 males; age range: 15.6-29.3 years,
	mean age: 22.1 years) with the corresponding coefficients of gender-
	and age-matched sighted volunteers. Compared with the sighted subjects,
	the blind demonstrated the decreased functional connectivities within
	the occipital visual cortices as well as between the occipital visual
	cortices and the parietal somatosensory, frontal motor and temporal
	multisensory cortices. Such differences may support the general loss
	hypothesis. However, we also found that the introduction of Braille
	earlier in life and for longer daily practice times produced stronger
	functional connectivities between these brain areas. These findings
	may support the compensatory plasticity hypothesis. Additionally,
	we found several increased functional connectivities between the
	occipital cortices and frontal language cortices in those with early
	onset of blindness, which indicate the predominance of compensatory
	plasticity. Our findings indicate that changes in the functional
	connectivities in the resting state may be an integrated reflection
	of general loss and compensatory plasticity when a single sensory

  abstract = {{Brains are restless. We have long known of the existence of a great
	deal of uninterrupted brain activity that maintains the body in a
	stable state--from an evolutionary standpoint one of the brain's
	most ancient tasks. But intrinsic, ongoing activity is not limited
	to subcortical, life-maintaining structures; cortex, too, is remarkably
	active even in the absence of a sensory stimulus or a specific behavioral
	task. This is evident both in its enormous energy consumption at
	rest and in the large, spontaneous but coherent fluctuations of neural
	activity that spread across different areas. Not surprisingly, a
	growing number of electrophysiological and functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (fMRI) studies are appearing that report on various aspects
	of the brain's spontaneous activity or "default mode" of operation.
	One recent study reports results from simultaneously combined electrophysiological
	and fMRI measurements in the monkey visual cortex (Shmuel, A., Leopold,
	D.A., 2008. Neuronal correlates of spontaneous fluctuations in fMRI
	signals in monkey visual cortex: implications for functional connectivity
	at rest. Hum. Brain Mapp. 29, 751-761). The authors claim to be able
	to demonstrate correlations between slow fluctuations in blood-oxygen-level-dependent
	(BOLD) signals and concurrent fluctuations in the underlying, locally
	measured neuronal activity. They even go on to speculate that the
	fluctuations display wave-like spatiotemporal patterns across cortex.
	In the present report, however, we re-analyze the data presented
	in that study and demonstrate that the measurements were not actually
	taken during rest. Visual cortex was subject to almost imperceptible
	but physiologically clearly detectable flicker induced by the visual
	stimulator. An examination of the power spectral density of the neural
	responses and the neurovascular impulse response function shows that
	such imperceptible flicker strongly suppresses the slow oscillations
	and changes the degree of covariance between neural and vascular
	signals. In addition, a careful analysis of the spatiotemporal patterns
	demonstrates that no slow waves of activity exist in visual cortex;
	instead, the presented wave data reflect differences in signal-to-noise
	ratio at various cortical sites due to local differences in vascularization.
	In this report, assuming that the term "spontaneous activity" refers
	to intrinsic physiological processes at the absence of sensory inputs
	or motor outputs, we discuss the need for careful selection of experimental
	protocols and of examining the degree to which the activation of
	sensory areas might influence the cortical or subcortical processes
	in other brain regions.}},

  abstract = {{An important issue in functional MRI analysis is accurate characterisation
	of the noise processes present in the data. Whilst conventional fMRI
	noise representations often assume stationarity (or time-invariance)
	in the noise generating sources, such approaches may serve to suppress
	important dynamic information about brain function. As an alternative
	to these fixed temporal assumptions, we present in this paper two
	time-varying procedures for examining nonstationary noise structure
	in fMRI data. In the first procedure, we approximate nonstationary
	behaviour by means of a collection of simple but numerous time-varying
	parametric models. This is accomplished through the derivation of
	a locally parametric AutoRegressive (AR) plus drift model which tracks
	temporal covariance by allowing the model parameters to evolve over
	time. Before exploring time variation in these parameters, window-widths
	(bandwidths) that are well suited to the latent time-varying noise
	structure must be determined. To do this, we employ a bandwidth selection
	mechanism based on Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) criterion.
	In the second procedure, we describe the fMRI noise using a nonparametric
	method based on Functional Data Analysis (FDA). This process generates
	well-conditioned nonstationary covariance estimates that reflect
	temporal continuity in the underlying data structure whilst penalizing
	effective model dimension. We demonstrate both methods on simulated
	data and investigate the presence of nonstationary noise in resting
	fMRI data using the whitening capabilities of the locally parametric
	procedure. We evaluate the comparative behaviour of the stationary
	and nonstationary AR-based methods on data acquired at 1.5, 3 and
	7 T magnetic field strengths and show that incorporation of time
	variation in the AR parameters leads to an overall decrease in the
	level of residual structure in the data. The FDA noise modelling
	technique is formulated within an activation mapping procedure and
	compared to the SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) toolbox on a
	cognitive face recognition task. Both the SPM and FDA methods show
	good sensitivity on this task, but we find that inclusion of the
	nonstationary FDA noise model seems to improve detection power in
	important task-related medial temporal regions.}},

  abstract = {{Recent studies indicate that functional connectivity using low-frequency
	BOLD fluctuations (LFBFs) is reduced between the bilateral primary
	sensorimotor regions in multiple sclerosis. In addition, it has been
	shown that pathway-dependent measures of the transverse diffusivity
	of water in white matter correlate with related clinical measures
	of functional deficit in multiple sclerosis. Taken together, these
	methods suggest that MRI methods can be used to probe both functional
	connectivity and anatomic connectivity in subjects with known white
	matter impairment. We report the results of a study comparing anatomic
	connectivity of the transcallosal motor pathway, as measured with
	diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional connectivity of the
	bilateral primary sensorimotor cortices (SMC), as measured with LFBFs
	in the resting state. High angular resolution diffusion imaging was
	combined with functional MRI to define the transcallosal white matter
	pathway connecting the bilateral primary SMC. Maps were generated
	from the probabilistic tracking employed and these maps were used
	to calculate the mean pathway diffusion measures fractional anisotropy
	〈FA〉, mean diffusivity 〈MD〉, longitudinal diffusivity 〈λ1〉, and transverse
	diffusivity 〈λ2〉. These were compared with LFBF-based functional
	connectivity measures (Fc) obtained at rest in a cohort of 11 multiple
	sclerosis patients and ∼10 age- and gender-matched control subjects.
	The correlation between 〈FA〉 and Fc for MS patients was r = −0.63,
	P < 0.04. The correlation between all subjects 〈λ2〉 and Fc was r
	= 0.42, P < 0.05. The correlation between all subjects 〈λ2〉 and Fc
	was r = −0.50, P < 0.02. None of the control subject correlations
	were significant, nor were 〈FA〉, 〈λ1〉, or 〈MD〉 significantly correlated
	with Fc for MS patients. This constitutes the first in vivo observation

	in functional MRI (fMRI) time course data. Methods for dealing with
	this effect are studied. METHOD: Simulations and fMRI data are used
	to study three statistical models that account for baseline drift.
	A method is proposed in which the time course data are linear least-squares
	fit to a reference function that includes the slope of the baseline
	drift as a free parameter. RESULTS: It is shown that the least-squares
	method is equivalent to cross-correlation with Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.
	Additionally, it is shown that certain paradigm designs improve the
	sensitivity of statistical tests when using any of the drift correction
	methods commonly employed. The least-squares method results in a
	variety of useful parameters such as activation amplitude, with a
	well characterized error. CONCLUSION: Very simple techniques can
	effectively account for observed drifts. It is important to design
	paradigms that are symmetric about the midpoint of the time series.
	In calculating confidence levels, a proper statistical model that
	accounts for baseline drifts is necessary to ensure accurate confidence

	Our aims are (1) to empirically compare the detection performance
	of a range of techniques using simulations of a simple image phantom
	and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, and (2) to
	construct two near-optimal detectors, both generalized likelihood
	ratio tests as upper performance bounds.We found that for finite
	samples of (10-100) images, even when the t-test with single-voxel
	variance estimates (single-voxel t-test) is the "correct" (i.e. unbiased)
	model for simple local additive signals, better detection performance
	is obtained using pooled variance estimates or adaptive, multivariate
	covariance-based detectors. Normalization by voxel-based variance
	estimates causes significantly decreased detection performance using
	either single-voxel t-tests or correlation-coefficient thresholding
	compared to pooled-variance t-tests or covariance thresholding, respectively.
	Moreover, we found that SVD by itself, or followed by an adaptive
	Fisher linear discriminant, provides a detector that is (1) more
	sensitive to mean differences than a single-voxel t-test, (2) insensitive
	to the large local signal variances detected by covariance thresholding,

	(BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are many. Familiar
	sources include low-frequency drift due to hardware imperfections,
	oscillatory noise due to respiration and cardiac pulsation and residual
	movement artefacts not accounted for by rigid body registration.
	These contributions give rise to temporal autocorrelation in the
	residuals of the fMRI signal and invalidate the statistical analysis
	as the errors are no longer independent. The low-frequency drift
	is often removed by high-pass filtering, and other effects are typically
	modelled as an autoregressive (AR) process. In this paper, we propose
	an alternative approach: Nuisance Variable Regression (NVR). By inclusion
	of confounding effects in a general linear model (GLM), we first
	confirm that the spatial distribution of the various fMRI noise sources
	is similar to what has already been described in the literature.
	Subsequently, we demonstrate, using diagnostic statistics, that removal
	of these contributions reduces first and higher order autocorrelation
	as well as non-normality in the residuals, thereby improving the
	validity of the drawn inferences. In addition, we also compare the

  abstract = {{Biological organisms continuously select and sample information used
	by their neural structures for perception and action, and for creating
	coherent cognitive states guiding their autonomous behavior. Information
	processing, however, is not solely an internal function of the nervous
	system. Here we show, instead, how sensorimotor interaction and body
	morphology can induce statistical regularities and information structure
	in sensory inputs and within the neural control architecture, and
	how the flow of information between sensors, neural units, and effectors
	is actively shaped by the interaction with the environment. We analyze
	sensory and motor data collected from real and simulated robots and
	reveal the presence of information structure and directed information
	flow induced by dynamically coupled sensorimotor activity, including
	effects of motor outputs on sensory inputs. We find that information
	structure and information flow in sensorimotor networks (a) is spatially
	and temporally specific; (b) can be affected by learning, and (c)
	can be affected by changes in body morphology. Our results suggest
	a fundamental link between physical embeddedness and information,
	highlighting the effects of embodied interactions on internal (neural)
	information processing, and illuminating the role of various system
	components on the generation of behavior. How neurons encode and
	process information is a key problem in computational biology and
	neuroscience. In this paper, Lungarella and Sporns present a novel
	application of computational methods to the integration of neural
	and sensorimotor processes at the systems-level scale. The central
	result of their study is that sensorimotor interaction and body morphology
	can induce statistical regularities and information structure in
	sensory inputs and within the neural control architecture. The informational
	content of inputs is thus not independent of output, and the authors
	suggest that neural coding needs to be considered in the context
	of the '' embeddedness'' of the organism within its eco-niche. Using
	robots and nonlinear time-series analysis techniques, they investigate
	how the flow of information between sensors, neural units, and effectors
	is actively shaped by interaction with the environment. This study
	represents a first step towards the development of an explicit quantitative
	framework that unifies neural and behavioral processes. Such a framework
	could also shed significant new light on key constraints shaping

	<D>] in white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) structures in the

	subjects at 3.0 T and mean diffusivity. We found some degree of linear

	(ROI)-based analysis, we also observed several structures which seemed
	to deviate significantly from a linear relationship. From all investigated
	relationships between various diffusion tensor measures and myelin-water

	We confirmed that WM structures, in general, have higher diffusional
	anisotropy than GM structures and also have higher myelin-water content.

	arrangement of compact WM structures such as the genu of the corpus
	callosum, elevated degrees of diffusional anisotropies are measured,

	but more likely reflect the highly organized directionality of fibre
	bundles in these areas (low microscopic and macroscopic tortuosity)
	as well as strongly restricted diffusion in the interstitial space

	fibre bundles and multiple fibre crossings, such as the minor and
	major forceps, low FA values were measured, which does not necessarily

	indications of an existing structure (cluster validation). In order
	to achieve that the selected partition is actually the best characterization

	while the activation behavior of the cellular neuronal network of
	Caenorhabditis elegans is strongly influenced by hub nodes. These

	Many complex biological networks are characterized by the coexistence

	We then evaluated the impact of modules and hub nodes on the network
	dynamics by correlating the patterns of node activity with the network
	architecture at difference levels of spontaneous network activation.
	Two dynamic regimes were observed: waves propagating from central
	nodes and module-based synchronization. Remarkably, the dynamic behavior
	of hierarchical modular networks switched between these modes as
	the level of spontaneous activation changed. We also found that the
	two dynamic regimes have different significance in the neuronal network
	of C. elegans, where activity is mainly organized by hub nodes, and
	the systems network of the cat cerebral cortex, which is dominated
	by the network's modular organization. Our approach can be used to
	dynamically explore the organization of complex neural networks,
	beyond the structural characterizations that were available previously.}},

  abstract = {{This paper presents algorithms for hierarchical, agglomerative clustering
	which perform most efficiently in the general-purpose setup that
	is given in modern standard software. Requirements are: (1) the input
	data is given by pairwise dissimilarities between data points, but
	extensions to vector data are also discussed (2) the output is a
	"stepwise dendrogram", a data structure which is shared by all implementations
	in current standard software. We present algorithms (old and new)
	which perform clustering in this setting efficiently, both in an
	asymptotic worst-case analysis and from a practical point of view.
	The main contributions of this paper are: (1) We present a new algorithm
	which is suitable for any distance update scheme and performs significantly
	better than the existing algorithms. (2) We prove the correctness
	of two algorithms by Rohlf and Murtagh, which is necessary in each
	case for different reasons. (3) We give well-founded recommendations

	content of a stimulus. Recent neuroimaging studies provide evidence
	about the neural mechanisms of perceptual decision making on emotional
	stimuli. However, the effect of individual differences in cognitive
	processing of emotions on perceptual decision making remains poorly
	understood. Here, we investigated how changes in the fMRI signal
	during perceptual decision making on facial stimuli covaried with
	individual differences in the ability to identify and communicate
	one's emotional state. Although this personality trait covaried with
	changes in activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)
	during gender decisions on facial expressions, there was no correlation
	during emotion decisions. Further, we investigated whether individual
	differences in the ability to cognitively process emotions depend
	on differences in the functional integration of emotional and cognitive
	brain regions. We therefore compared task-dependent changes in effective
	connectivity of dACC in individuals with good and with poor ability
	to cognitively process emotions using a psychophysiological interaction
	analysis. We found greater coupling of dACC with prefrontal regions
	in individuals with good ability to identify and communicate their
	emotional state. Conversely, individuals with poor ability in this
	domain showed greater coupling of dACC with the amygdala. Our data
	indicate that individual differences in the ability to identify and
	communicate one's emotional state are reflected by altered effective
	connectivity of the dACC with prefrontal and limbic regions. Thus,
	we provide neurophysiological evidence for a theoretical model that
	posits that a discommunication between limbic areas and the neocortex
	impairs cognitive processing of emotions.}},

  abstract = {{We present a technique for removing global effects from functional
	magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) images, using a voxel-level linear
	model of the global signal (LMGS). The procedure does not assume
	low-frequency global effects and is based on the assumption that
	the global signal (the time course of the average intensity per volume)
	is replicated in the same pattern throughout the brain, although
	not necessarily at the same magnitude. A second assumption is that
	all effects that match the global signal are of no interest and can
	be removed. The method involves modeling the time course of each
	voxel to the global signal and removing any such global component
	from the voxel's time course. A challenge that elicits a large change
	in the global blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, inspired
	hypercapnia (5\% CO(2)/95\% O(2)), was administered to 14 subjects
	during a 144-s, 24-scan fMRI procedure; baseline series were also
	collected. The method was applied to these data and compared to intensity
	normalization and low-frequency spline detrending. A large global
	BOLD signal increase emerged to the hypercapnic challenge. Intensity
	normalization failed to remove global components due to regional
	variability. Both LMGS and spline detrending effectively removed
	low-frequency components, but unlike spline detrending (which is
	designed to remove only low frequency trends), the LMGS removed higher-frequency
	global fluctuations throughout the challenge and baseline series.
	LMGS removes all effects correlated with the global signal, and may
	be especially useful for fMRI data that include large global effects
	and for generating detrended images to use with subsequent volume-of-interest

	Simulations showed that both methods become inaccurate in lower SNR
	conditions, leading to many false positive detections. However, the
	time--frequency estimator showed better performance than the time-domain
	one. Key parameters for each algorithm were identified and results
	suggest to model confounds in the GLM differently for oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin.
	We also demonstrated that an inaccurate marking of epileptic events

	specification of the hemodynamic response function delay decreases
	drastically the detection abilities. Finally, we illustrated the

	can be crudely grouped into three main categories in which different
	philosophies are applied to delineate activated regions. These being
	type I error control thresholding, false discovery rate (FDR) control
	thresholding and posterior probability thresholding. To better understand
	the properties of these main approaches, we carried out a simulation
	study to compare the approaches as they would be used on real data
	sets. Using default settings, we find that posterior probability
	thresholding is the most powerful approach, and type I error control
	thresholding provides the lowest levels of type I error. False discovery
	rate control thresholding performs in between the other approaches
	for both these criteria, although for some parameter settings this
	approach can approximate the performance of posterior probability
	thresholding. Based on these results, we discuss the relative merits
	of the three approaches in an attempt to decide upon an optimal approach.
	We conclude that viewing the problem of delineating areas of activation
	as a classification problem provides a highly interpretable framework
	for comparing the methods. Within this framework, we highlight the
	role of the loss function, which explicitly penalizes the types of
	errors that may occur in a given analysis.}},

  abstract = {{There are many ways to detect activation patterns in a time series
	of observations at a single voxel in a functional magnetic resonance
	imaging study. The critical problem is to estimate the statistical
	significance, which depends on the estimation of both the magnitude
	of the response to the stimulus and the serial dependence of the
	time series and especially on the assumptions made in that estimation.
	We show that for experimental designs with periodic stimuli, only
	a few aspects of the serial dependence are important and these can
	be estimated reliably via nonparametric estimation of the spectral
	density of the time series, whereas existing techniques are biased
	by their assumptions. The linear model with (stationary) serially
	dependent errors can be analyzed entirely in frequency domain, and
	doing so provides many insights. In particular, we introduce a technique
	to detect periodic activations and show that it has a distribution
	theory that enables us to assign significance levels down to 1 in
	100,000, levels which are needed when a whole brain image is under
	consideration. Nonparametric spectral density estimation is shown
	to be self-calibrating and accurate when compared to several other
	time-domain approaches. The technique is especially resistant to
	high frequency artefacts that we have found in some datasets and
	we demonstrate that time-domain approaches may be sufficiently susceptible
	to these effects to give misleading results. The method is easily
	generalized to handle event-related designs. We found it necessary
	to consider the trends in the time series carefully and use nonlinear
	filters to remove the trends and robust techniques to remove '' spikes.''
	Using this in connection with our techniques allows us to detect
	activations in clumps of a few (even one) voxel in periodic designs,
	yet produce essentially no false positive detections at any voxels
	in null datasets.}},

  abstract = {{For fMRI time-series analysis to be statistically valid, it is important
	to deal correctly with temporal autocorrelation in the noise. Most
	of the approaches in the literature adopt a two-stage approach in
	which the autocorrelation structure is estimated using the residuals
	of an initial model fit. This estimate is then used to "prewhiten"
	the data and the model before the model is refit to obtain final
	activation parameter estimates. An assumption implicit in this scheme
	is that the residuals from the initial model fit represent a realization
	of the "true" noise process. In general this assumption will not
	be correct as certain components of the noise will be removed by
	the model fit. In this paper we examine (i) the form of the bias
	induced by the initial model fit, (ii) methods of correcting for
	the bias, and (iii) the impact of bias correction on the model parameter
	estimates. We find that while bias correction does result in more
	accurate estimates of the correlation structure, this does not translate

  abstract = {{RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a
	minimally invasive imaging modality that provides three-dimensional
	distribution data for a radioactive tracer concentration within the
	body. Local functional parameters are estimated from these images
	by fitting tracer kinetic data with mathematical models. However,
	in some applications, the reliability of parameter estimates may
	be hindered by the presence of noise. In the accompanying report
	in this issue of Academic Radiology, a novel method using principal
	component analysis (PCA) was presented and used for deriving parametric
	images of lung function from imaged tracer kinetics of intravenously
	injected nitrogen 13 (13NN) in saline solution. The PCA method averages
	13NN concentrations from groups of voxels (volume elements) selected
	for their similarity in kinetics, rather than their spatial proximity.
	The goal of this study is to conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to
	evaluate the robustness to noise of parameters derived by means of
	the PCA method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This evaluation involved:
	(1) generating "noise-free" synthetic PET images from experimental
	PET data, (2) adding noise to these images, (3) applying the PCA
	method to yield parametric images, and (4) comparing these parametric
	images with original noise-free images. RESULTS: Local parameters
	recovered by using the PCA method deviated from noise-free parameters
	on average by less than 1\% for up to 32-fold of expected noise levels.
	These deviations were much less than those (>10\%) recovered by using
	a direct curve-fitting method. CONCLUSION: The novel PCA approach
	provides robust parametric lung functional images while preserving
	the spatial resolution of the original images.}},

  abstract = {{The Human Connectome Project (HCP) is a major endeavor that will
	acquire and analyze connectivity data plus other neuroimaging, behavioral,
	and genetic data from 1,200 healthy adults. It will serve as a key
	resource for the neuroscience research community, enabling discoveries
	of how the brain is wired and how it functions in different individuals.
	To fulfill its potential, the HCP consortium is developing an informatics
	platform that will handle: (1) storage of primary and processed data,
	(2) systematic processing and analysis of the data, (3) open-access
	data-sharing, and (4) mining and exploration of the data. This informatics
	platform will include two primary components. ConnectomeDB will provide
	database services for storing and distributing the data, as well
	as data analysis pipelines. Connectome Workbench will provide visualization
	and exploration capabilities. The platform will be based on standard
	data formats and provide an open set of application programming interfaces
	(APIs) that will facilitate broad utilization of the data and integration
	of HCP services into a variety of external applications. Primary
	and processed data generated by the HCP will be openly shared with
	the scientific community, and the informatics platform will be available
	under an open source license. This paper describes the HCP informatics
	platform as currently envisioned and places it into the context of
	the overall HCP vision and agenda.}},

	provides a number of quality control and productivity features, including
	data entry forms, data-type-specific searches, searches that combine
	across data types, detailed reports, and listings of experimental
	data, upload/download tools, access to standard laboratory workflows,
	and administration and security tools. XNAT also includes an online
	image viewer that supports a number of common neuroimaging formats,
	including DICOM and Analyze. The viewer can be extended to support
	additional formats and to generate custom displays. By managing data

  abstract = {{Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a nexus of information processing
	and regulation in the brain. Reflecting this central role, ACC is
	structurally and functionally heterogeneous, a fact long appreciated
	in studies of non-human primates. Human neuroimaging studies also
	recognize this functional heterogeneity, with meta-analyses and task-based
	studies demonstrating the existence of motor, cognitive and affective
	subdivisions. In contrast to task-based approaches, examinations
	of resting-state functional connectivity enable the characterization
	of task-independent patterns of correlated activity. In a novel approach
	to understanding ACC functional segregation, we systematically mapped
	ACC functional connectivity during rest. We examined patterns of
	functional connectivity for 16 seed ROIs systematically placed throughout
	caudal, rostral, and subgenual ACC in each hemisphere. First, our
	data support the commonly observed rostral/caudal distinction, but
	also suggest the existence of a dorsal/ventral functional distinction.
	For each of these distinctions, more fine-grained patterns of differentiation
	were observed than commonly appreciated in human imaging studies.
	Second, we demonstrate the presence of negatively predicted relationships
	between distinct ACC functional networks. In particular, we highlight
	negative relationships between rostral ACC-based affective networks
	(including the '' default mode network'') and dorsal--caudal ACC-based
	frontoparietal attention networks. Finally, interhemispheric activations
	were more strongly correlated between homologous regions than in
	non-homologous regions. We discuss the implications of our work for
	understanding ACC function and potential applications to clinical
	populations.}},

	functional connectivity were demonstrated within the precuneus of
	both species, with each subdivision suggesting a discrete functional
	role: (i) the anterior precuneus, functionally connected with the
	superior parietal cortex, paracentral lobule, and motor cortex, suggesting
	a sensorimotor region; (ii) the central precuneus, functionally connected
	to the dorsolateral prefrontal, dorsomedial prefrontal, and multimodal
	lateral inferior parietal cortex, suggesting a cognitive/associative
	region; and (iii) the posterior precuneus, displaying functional
	connectivity with adjacent visual cortical regions. These functional
	connectivity patterns were differentiated from the more ventral networks
	associated with the posterior cingulate, which connected with limbic
	structures such as the medial temporal cortex, dorsal and ventromedial
	prefrontal regions, posterior lateral inferior parietal regions,

	Moreover, convergence of the corresponding algorithms is slow, precluding
	applications on a large scale. In this paper, we propose a novel
	Bayesian strategy to deal with structure learning. Relating graphs
	to their supports, we convert the problem of model selection into
	that of parameter estimation. Use of non-informative priors and asymptotic
	results yield a posterior probability for independence graph supports
	in closed form. Gibbs sampling is then applied to approximate the
	full joint posterior density. We finally give three examples of structure
	learning, one from synthetic data, and the two others from real data.}},

	Unfortunately, none has been able to provide a relevant, self-contained,

	a first step in this direction. We first introduce a common terminology
	together with a cross-modal definition of interaction. In this setting,
	we investigate the commonalities shared by some measures of interaction
	proposed in the literature. We show that temporal correlation, nonlinear
	correlation, mutual information, generalized synchronization, phase
	synchronization, coherence, and phase locking value (PLV) actually
	measure the same quantity (namely correlation) when one is investigating
	linear interactions between independently and identically distributed
	Gaussian variables. We also demonstrate that these data-driven measures
	can only partly account for the interaction patterns that can be
	expressed by the effective connectivity of structural equation modeling

  abstract = {{This paper introduces a new tool for functional neuroimage analysis:
	partial least squares (PLS). It is unique as a multivariate method
	in its choice of emphasis for analysis, that being the covariance
	between brain images and exogenous blocks representing either the
	experiment design or some behavioral measure. What emerges are spatial
	patterns of brain activity that represent the optimal association
	between the images and either of the blocks. This process differs
	substantially from other multivariate methods in that rather than
	attempting to predict the individual values of the image pixels,
	PLS attempts to explain the relation between image pixels and task
	or behavior. Data from a face encoding and recognition PET rCBF study
	are used to illustrate two types of PLS analysis: an activation analysis
	of task with images and a brain-behavior analysis. The commonalities
	across the two analyses are suggestive of a general face memory network
	differentially engaged during encoding and recognition. PLS thus
	serves as an important extension by extracting new information from
	imaging data that is not accessible through other currently used
	univariate and multivariate image analysis tools.}},

	modeling. In structural equation modeling, connections between brain
	areas are based on known neuroanatomy, and the interregional covariances
	of activity are used to calculate path coefficients representing
	the magnitude of the influence of each directional path. The logic
	behind the use of structural equation modeling stems from the suggestion
	that brain function is the result of changes in the covariances of
	activity among neural elements. The technical foundations for neural
	structural equation models are presented, emphasizing the ability
	to make inferential comparisons to evaluate the experimental changes
	in path coefficients. Simulated data sets were used to test the effects
	of omitted regions and omitted connections. The results suggested
	that structural modeling algorithms can give hints as to possible
	external influences and missing paths, but that the final decision

	The anatomical framework for the structural equation models revealed

	(average = 12.5 s), and long-delay (21 s) tasks were considered.
	From the idea that brain function is the result of neural interactions,
	the data were analysed using anatomically based, covariance structural
	equation modeling. In perceptual matching, the dominant functional
	interactions were observed among the ventral cortical areas, from
	extrastriate regions, to the anterior temporal, and into the inferior
	prefrontal cortex. These interactions decreased with longer delay
	intervals. In the short-delay functional model, interactions along
	this ventral stream in the right hemisphere appeared to be rerouted
	through limbic areas with strong interactions among the hippocampal
	region, the anterior and posterior cingulate, and the inferior prefrontal
	cortices. For the intermediate-delay model, the hippocampocingulate
	interactions continued, but showed a shift to more left hemisphere
	involvement. In the long-delay network, interactions within the right
	limbic circuit were reduced in favor of strong bilateral inferior
	prefrontal and frontocingulate interactions. Effects from the prefrontal
	cortex, especially from the left hemisphere, to temporal and occipito-temporal
	cortices were particularly strong in the long-delay model, suggesting
	recruitment of some of the same circuits primarily involved in face
	perception. The strong corticolimbic interactions at short and intermediate
	delays may represent maintenance of an iconic representation of the
	face during the retention interval. However, at longer delays, where
	image was more difficult to maintain, a frontocingulate-occipital
	network was used that could represent an expanded encoding strategy

	on the independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm of Bell and
	Sejnowski ([1995]: Neural Comput 7:1129-1159). We decomposed eight
	fMRI data sets from 4 normal subjects performing Stroop color-naming,
	the Brown and Peterson work/number task, and control tasks into spatially
	independent components. Each component consisted of voxel values
	at fixed three-dimensional locations (a component "map"), and a unique
	associated time course of activation. Given data from 144 time points
	collected during a 6-min trial, ICA extracted an equal number of
	spatially independent components. In all eight trials, ICA derived
	one and only one component with a time course closely matching the
	time course of 40-sec alternations between experimental and control
	tasks. The regions of maximum activity in these consistently task-related
	components generally overlapped active regions detected by standard
	correlational analysis, but included frontal regions not detected
	by correlation. Time courses of other ICA components were transiently
	task-related, quasiperiodic, or slowly varying. By utilizing higher-order
	statistics to enforce successively stricter criteria for spatial
	independence between component maps, both the ICA algorithm and a
	related fourth-order decomposition technique (Comon [1994]: Signal
	Processing 36:11-20) were superior to principal component analysis
	(PCA) in determining the spatial and temporal extent of task-related
	activation. For each subject, the time courses and active regions
	of the task-related ICA components were consistent across trials
	and were robust to the addition of simulated noise. Simulated movement
	artifact and simulated task-related activations added to actual fMRI
	data were clearly separated by the algorithm. ICA can be used to
	distinguish between nontask-related signal components, movements,
	and other artifacts, as well as consistently or transiently task-related
	fMRI activations, based on only weak assumptions about their spatial
	distributions and without a priori assumptions about their time courses.
	ICA appears to be a highly promising method for the analysis of fMRI
	data from normal and clinical populations, especially for uncovering
	unpredictable transient patterns of brain activity associated with
	performance of psychomotor tasks.}},

	different subjects may seem counterintuitive but embodies two key
	advantages. First, it allows one to test directly for differences
	among subjects by comparing models that do and do not allow a particular
	connectivity parameter to vary over subjects. Second, a multisubject
	network provides additional degrees of freedom to estimate the model's
	free parameters. Any neurobiological hypothesis normally addressed
	by single-subject or group analyses can still be tested, but with
	greater sensitivity. The common influence of experimental variables
	is modeled by connecting a virtual node, whose time course reflects
	stimulus onsets, to the sensory or "input" region in all subjects.
	Further experimental changes in task or cognitive set enter through
	modulation of the connections. This approach allows one to model
	both endogenous (or intrinsic) variance and exogenous effects induced
	by experimental design. We present a functional magnetic resonance
	imaging study that uses a multisubject network to investigate intersubject
	variability in functional integration in the context of single word
	and pseudoword reading. We tested whether the effect of word type
	on the reading-related coupling differed significantly among subjects.
	Our results showed that a number of forward and backward connections
	were stronger for reading pseudowords than words, and, in one case,
	connectivity showed significant intersubject variability. The discussion
	focuses on the implications of our findings and on further applications
	of the multisubject network analysis.}},

	imaging (fMRI) time-series reveals distinct coactivation patterns

	In this study, we assessed the reproducibility of the DMN components

	(mean age, 27.5 years) who were scanned three times with two resting
	state scans during each session at 3.0 T field strength. Statistical

	DMN activity and size of overlap within and between sessions were
	most reproducible for the anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus.
	The degree of reproducibility of the DMN agrees with the degree of

	It is based on subsampling in combination with (high dimensional)
	selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and
	has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides
	finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and
	hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularization
	for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation
	improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection
	is applied. We prove for the randomized lasso that stability selection
	will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions
	for consistency of the original lasso method are violated. We demonstrate
	stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical

  abstract = {{ The resting brain exhibits coherent patterns of spontaneous low-frequency
	BOLD fluctuations. These so-called resting-state functional connectivity
	(RSFC) networks are posited to reflect intrinsic representations
	of functional systems commonly implicated in cognitive function.
	Yet, the direct relationship between RSFC and the BOLD response induced
	by task performance remains unclear. Here we examine the relationship
	between a region's pattern of RSFC across participants and that same
	region's level of BOLD activation during an Eriksen Flanker task.
	To achieve this goal we employed a voxel-matched regression method,
	which assessed whether the magnitude of task-induced activity at
	each brain voxel could be predicted by measures of RSFC strength
	for the same voxel, across 26 healthy adults. We examined relationships
	between task-induced activation and RSFC strength for six different
	seed regions [Fox, M.D., Snyder, A.Z., Vincent, J.L., Corbetta, M.,

	Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 102, 9673-9678.], as well as the "default
	mode" and "task-positive" resting-state networks in their entirety.
	Our results indicate that, for a number of brain regions, inter-individual
	differences in task-induced BOLD activity were predicted by one of
	two resting-state properties: (1) the region's positive connectivity
	strength with the task-positive network, or (2) its negative connectivity
	with the default mode network. Strikingly, most of the regions exhibiting
	a significant relationship between their RSFC properties and task-induced
	BOLD activity were located in transition zones between the default
	mode and task-positive networks. These results suggest that a common
	mechanism governs many brain regions' neural activity during rest
	and its neural activity during task performance. 2010 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {{Sensory information undergoes extensive associative elaboration and
	attentional modulation as it becomes incorporated into the texture
	of cognition. This process occurs along a core synaptic hierarchy
	which includes the primary sensory, upstream unimodal, downstream
	unimodal, heteromodal, paralimbic and limbic zones of the cerebral
	cortex. Connections from one zone to another are reciprocal and allow
	higher synaptic levels to exert a feedback (top-down) influence upon
	earlier levels of processing. Each cortical area provides a nexus
	for the convergence of afferents and divergence of efferents. The
	resultant synaptic organization supports parallel as well as serial
	processing, and allows each sensory event to initiate multiple cognitive
	and behavioural outcomes. Upstream sectors of unimodal association
	areas encode basic features of sensation such as colour, motion,
	form and pitch. More complex contents of sensory experience such
	as objects, faces, word-forms, spatial locations and sound sequences
	become encoded within downstream sectors of unimodal areas by groups
	of coarsely tuned neurons. The highest synaptic levels of sensory-fugal
	processing are occupied by heteromodal, paralimbic and limbic cortices,
	collectively known as transmodal areas. The unique role of these
	areas is to bind multiple unimodal and other transmodal areas into
	distributed but integrated multimodal representations. Transmodal
	areas in the midtemporal cortex, Wernicke's area, the hippocampal-entorhinal
	complex and the posterior parietal cortex provide critical gateways
	for transforming perception into recognition, word-forms into meaning,
	scenes and events into experiences, and spatial locations into targets
	for exploration. All cognitive processes arise from analogous associative
	transformations of similar sets of sensory inputs. The differences
	in the resultant cognitive operation are determined by the anatomical
	and physiological properties of the transmodal node that acts as
	the critical gateway for the dominant transformation. Interconnected
	sets of transmodal nodes provide anatomical and computational epicentres
	for large-scale neurocognitive networks. In keeping with the principles
	of selectively distributed processing, each epicentre of a large-scale
	network displays a relative specialization for a specific behavioural
	component of its principal neurospychological domain. The destruction
	of transmodal epicentres causes global impairments such as multimodal
	anomia, neglect and amnesia, whereas their selective disconnection
	from relevant unimodal areas elicits modality-specific impairments
	such as prosopagnosia, pure word blindness and category-specific
	anomias. The human brain contains at least five anatomically distinct
	networks. The network for spatial awareness is based on transmodal
	epicentres in the posterior parietal cortex and the frontal eye fields;
	the language network on epicentres in Wernicke's and Broca's areas;
	the explicit memory/emotion network on epicentres in the hippocampal-entorhinal
	complex and the amygdala; the face-object recognition network on
	epicentres in the midtemporal and temporopolar cortices; and the
	working memory-executive function network on epicentres in the lateral
	prefrontal cortex and perhaps the posterior parietal cortex. Individual
	sensory modalities give rise to streams of processing directed to
	transmodal nodes belonging to each of these networks. The fidelity
	of sensory channels is actively protected through approximately four
	synaptic levels of sensory-fugal processing. The modality-specific
	cortices at these four synaptic levels encode the most veridical
	representations of experience. Attentional, motivational and emotional
	modulations, including those related to working memory, novelty-seeking
	and mental imagery, become increasingly more pronounced within downstream
	components of unimodal areas, where they help to create a highly
	edited subjective version of the world. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)}},

	originated in the early 1960s and has recently attracted fresh support

	we investigate the hierarchical modular (or "modules-within-modules")
	decomposition of human brain functional networks, measured using
	functional magnetic resonance imaging in 18 healthy volunteers under
	no-task or resting conditions. We used a customized template to extract
	networks with more than 1800 regional nodes, and we applied a fast
	algorithm to identify nested modular structure at several hierarchical
	levels. We used mutual information, 0 < I < 1, to estimate the similarity
	of community structure of networks in different subjects, and to
	identify the individual network that is most representative of the
	group. Results show that human brain functional networks have a hierarchical
	modular organization with a fair degree of similarity between subjects,
	I = 0.63. The largest five modules at the highest level of the hierarchy
	were medial occipital, lateral occipital, central, parieto-frontal

	In this paper, we present a comparison between unsupervised clustering
	and ICA in a systematic fMRI study. The comparative results were
	evaluated by 1) task-related activation maps, 2) associated time-courses,
	and 3) receiver operating characteristic analysis. For the fMRI data,
	a comparative quantitative evaluation between the three clustering
	techniques, self-organizing map, "neural gas" network, and fuzzy
	clustering based on deterministic annealing, and the three ICA methods,
	FastICA, Infomax and topographic ICA was performed. The ICA methods
	proved to extract features relatively well for a small number of
	independent components but are limited to the linear mixture assumption.
	The unsupervised Clustering outperforms ICA in terms of classification
	results but requires a longer processing time than the ICA methods.}},

  abstract = {{Functional MRI (fMRI) has become one of the leading methods for brain
	mapping in neuroscience. Recent advances in fMRI analysis were used
	to define the default state of brain activity, functional connectivity
	and basal activity. Basal activity measured with fMRI raised tremendous
	interest among neuroscientists since synchronized brain activity
	pattern could be retrieved while the subject rests (resting state
	fMRI). During recent years, a few signal processing schemes have
	been suggested to analyze the resting state blood oxygenation level
	dependent (BOLD) signal from simple correlations to spectral decomposition.
	In most of these analysis schemes, the question asked was which brain
	areas '' behave'' in the time domain similarly to a pre-specified
	ROI. In this work we applied short time frequency analysis and clustering
	to study the spatial signal characteristics of resting state fMRI
	time series. Such analysis revealed that clusters of similar BOLD
	fluctuations are found in the cortex but also in the white matter
	and sub-cortical gray matter regions (thalamus). We found high similarities
	between the BOLD clusters and the neuro-anatomical appearance of
	brain regions. Additional analysis of the BOLD time series revealed
	a strong correlation between head movements and clustering quality.
	Experiments performed with T1-weighted time series also provided
	similar quality of clustering. These observations led us to the conclusion
	that non-functional contributions to the BOLD time series can also
	account for symmetric appearance of signal fluctuations. These contributions
	may include head motions, the underling microvasculature anatomy
	and cellular morphology.}},

	in terms of local structure (clustering coefficient) and overall
	integration (path length) and the "optimal" organization of the connectivity
	i.e., the small world network (SWN). The main findings were: (i)
	Enhanced synchronization for theta band during math more prominent

	band during math. (iii) The beta and especially gamma bands showed
	lower synchronization and signs of lower SWN organization in both
	situations in adults. There are interesting findings related to the
	two age groups and the two situations. The theta band showed higher
	synchronization during math in adults as a result of higher capacity
	of the working memory in this age group. The alpha2 band showed some
	SWN disorganization during math, a process analog to the known desynchronization.
	In adults, a dramatic reduction of the connections in gray matter
	occurs. Although this maturation process is probably related to higher

	This study presents a broad perspective on the influence of spatial
	smoothing on fMRI group activation results. The data obtained from
	20 volunteers during a visual oddball task were used for this study.
	Spatial smoothing using an isotropic gaussian filter kernel with
	full width at half maximum (FWHM) sizes 2 to 30 mm with a step of
	2 mm was applied in two levels - smoothing of fMRI data and/or smoothing
	of single-subject contrast files prior to general linear model random-effects
	group analysis generating statistical parametric maps. Five regions
	of interest were defined, and several parameters (coordinates of
	nearest local maxima, t value, corrected threshold, effect size,
	residual values, etc.) were evaluated to examine the effects of spatial
	smoothing. The optimal filter size for group analysis is discussed
	according to various criteria. For our experiment, the optimal FWHM
	is about 8 mm. We can conclude that for robust experiments and an
	adequate number of subjects in the study, the optimal FWHM for single-subject
	inference is similar to that for group inference (about 8 mm, according

  abstract = {{With increasing age, a subset of otherwise healthy individuals undergoes
	impairments in learning and memory that have been termed mild cognitive
	impairment (MCI). The enhanced neuronal activity associated with
	learning and memory requires increased cerebral blood flow (CBF)
	to specific brain regions. However, the interactions between cerebral
	blood flow and MCI remain unclear. In this study, we address whether
	baseline or hypercapnia-induced (increased blood CO(2) levels) changes
	in CBF are modified with age, and whether these measures are predictive
	of cognitive status in rodents. Adult and aged rats were evaluated
	using a hippocampally-dependent task in a water maze. Aged rats were
	classified as memory-impaired or memory-intact based on performance
	comparisons with adult rats. Cerebral blood flow was assessed using
	flow-alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) magnetic resonance imaging
	(MRI), before and after breathing 10\% CO(2). The transition period
	between CO(2) concentrations was examined with blood oxygen level
	dependent (BOLD) MRI. Separation of aged animals into memory-intact
	and impaired categories revealed increased basal perfusion in the
	dorsal hippocampus of memory-impaired versus memory-intact aged animals.
	Linear regression revealed that higher hippocampal perfusion was
	correlated with impaired memory in aged animals, and a logistic regression
	indicated that hippocampal perfusion predicted spatial memory ability.
	Several brain regions of aged rats demonstrated an attenuation of
	the perfusion increase normally observed in adult rats under hypercapnia.
	Memory-impaired animals were the primary contributor to this effect,
	as their perfusion response to hypercapnia was significantly reduced
	compared to adult animals. Aged, memory-intact animals were not significantly
	different from adults. BOLD MRI demonstrated a reduced response in
	aged animals to hypercapnia, with impaired animals being the primary
	contributor to the effect. A logistic regression model based on basal
	and hypercapnia perfusion correctly predicted cognitive status in
	83.3\% of animals tested. Our results indicate that age-related changes
	in vascular reactivity and perfusion are important contributing factors
	in memory impairment.}},

	general linear model (GLM), which assumes a known hemodynamic response
	function (HRF) to epileptic spikes. In contrast, independent component
	analysis (ICA) can extract blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)
	responses without imposing constraints on the HRF. ICA might therefore
	detect responses that vary in time and shape, and that are not detected
	in the GLM analysis. In this study, we compared the findings of ICA
	and GLM analyses in 12 patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy.
	Spatial ICA was used to extract independent components from the functional
	magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. A deconvolution method identified
	component time courses significantly related to the generalized EEG
	discharges, without constraining the shape of the HRF. The results
	from the ICA analysis were compared to those from the GLM analysis.
	GLM maps and ICA maps showed significant correlation and revealed
	BOLD responses in the thalamus, caudate nucleus, and default mode
	areas. In patients with a low rate of discharges per minute, the
	GLM analysis detected BOLD signal changes within the thalamus and
	the caudate nucleus that were not revealed by the ICA. In conclusion,
	ICA is a viable alternative technique to GLM analyses in EEG-fMRI
	studies related to generalized discharges. This study demonstrated
	that the BOLD response largely resembles the standard HRF and that
	GLM analysis is adequate. However, ICA is more dependent on a sufficient

  abstract = {{ Idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) is characterized by electroencephalography
	(EEG) recordings with generalized spike wave discharges (GSWDs) arising
	from normal background activity. Although GSWDs are the result of
	highly synchronized activity in the thalamocortical network, EEG
	without GSWDs is believed to represent normal brain activity. The
	aim of this study was to investigate whether thalamocortical interactions
	are altered even during GSWD-free EEG periods in patients with IGE.
	A GSWD-related group analysis was performed in 12 IGE patients to
	define seeds in areas involved during GSWDs. EEG-functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets from 22 IGE patients without GSWDs
	during the investigation and 30 age-matched healthy controls were
	then selected to investigate functional connectivity in GSWD-related
	areas. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes were extracted
	from seeds defined by the GSWD-related group analysis. The averaged
	time course within each seed was used to detect brain regions with
	BOLD signal correlated with the seed. Group differences between patients
	and controls were estimated. The GSWD-related group analysis showed
	BOLD activation in the thalamus, the frontomesial cortex, and the
	cerebellum and BOLD deactivation in default mode areas. For the connectivity
	analysis, eight seeds were placed bilaterally in the thalamus, mesial
	frontal cortex, precuneus, and cerebellum. The functional connectivity
	analysis of these seeds did not show clearly altered functional connectivity
	for patients versus controls. The results underscore the paroxysmal
	nature of GSWDs: Although GSWDs are characterized by highly synchronized

  journal = {NeuroImage},
  volume = {In Press, Corrected Proof},
  abstract = {{In the last few years, the notion that the brain has a default or
	intrinsic mode of functioning has received increasing attention.
	The idea derives from observations that a consistent network of brain
	regions shows high levels of activity when no explicit task is performed
	and participants are asked simply to rest. The importance of this
	putative "default mode" is asserted on the basis of the substantial
	energy demand associated with such a resting state and of the suggestion
	that rest entails a finely tuned balance between metabolic demand
	and regionally regulated blood supply. These observations, together
	with the fact that the default network is more active at rest than
	it is in a range of explicit tasks, have led some to suggest that
	it reflects an absolute baseline, one that must be understood and
	used if we are to develop a comprehensive picture of brain functioning.
	Here, we examine the assumptions that are generally made in accepting
	the importance of the "default mode". We question the value, and
	indeed the interpretability, of the study of the resting state and
	suggest that observations made under resting conditions have no privileged
	status as a fundamental metric of brain functioning. In doing so,
	we challenge the utility of studies of the resting state in a number

	dominant early-onset AD (FAD), (2) patients with mild cognitive impairment

	to AD with an estimated decline rate of 10-30\% per year, (3) normal
	young and middle-age subjects carriers of known susceptibility genes

	explored using experimental resting state data. In particular, the
	possibility is discussed that the "default network", being a brain
	area that deactivates during non-specific general tasks, is a hemodynamic
	effect caused by heart rate variations. Of fifteen healthy controls
	ECG, EEG and fMRI were co-registered. Slice time dependent heart
	rate regressors were derived from the ECG data and correlated to
	fMRI using a linear correlation analysis where the impulse response
	is estimated from the data. It was found that in most subjects substantial
	correlations between heart rate variations and fMRI exist, both within
	the brain and at the ventricles. The brain areas with high correlation
	to heart rate are different from the "default network" and the response
	functions deviate from the canonical hemodynamic response function.
	Furthermore, a general negative correlation was found between heart
	beat intervals (reverse of heart rate) and alpha power. We interpret
	this finding by assuming that subject's state varies between drowsiness
	and wakefulness. Finally, given this large correlation, we re-examined
	the contribution of heart rate variations to earlier reported fMRI/alpha
	band correlations, by adding heart rate regressors as confounders.
	It was found that inclusion of these confounders most often had a
	negligible effect. From its strong correlation to alpha power, we
	conclude that the heart rate variations contain important physiological
	information about subject's resting state. However, it does not provide
	a full explanation of the behaviour of the "default network". Its
	application as confounder in fMRI experiments is a relatively small
	computational effort, but may have a substantial impact in paradigms

  abstract = {{ Low-frequency fluctuations in fMRI signal have been used to map
	several consistent resting state networks in the brain. Using the
	posterior cingulate cortex as a seed region, functional connectivity
	analyses have found not only positive correlations in the default
	mode network but negative correlations in another resting state network
	related to attentional processes. The interpretation is that the
	human brain is intrinsically organized into dynamic, anti-correlated
	functional networks. Global variations of the BOLD signal are often
	considered nuisance effects and are commonly removed using a general
	linear model (GLM) technique. This global signal regression method
	has been shown to introduce negative activation measures in standard
	fMRI analyses. The topic of this paper is whether such a correction
	technique could be the cause of anti-correlated resting state networks
	in functional connectivity analyses. Here we show that, after global
	signal regression, correlation values to a seed voxel must sum to
	a negative value. Simulations also show that small phase differences
	between regions can lead to spurious negative correlation values.
	A combination breath holding and visual task demonstrates that the
	relative phase of global and local signals can affect connectivity
	measures and that, experimentally, global signal regression leads
	to bell-shaped correlation value distributions, centred on zero.
	Finally, analyses of negatively correlated networks in resting state
	data show that global signal regression is most likely the cause
	of anti-correlations. These results call into question the interpretation
	of negatively correlated regions in the brain when using global signal
	regression as an initial processing step. }},

  abstract = {Recent advances in MRI receiver and coil technologies have significantly
	improved image signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and thus temporal SNR
	(TSNR). These gains in SNR and TSNR have allowed the detection of
	fMRI signal changes at higher spatial resolution and therefore have
	increased the potential to localize small brain structures such as
	cortical layers and columns. The majority of current fMRI processing
	strategies employ multi-subject averaging and therefore require spatial
	smoothing and normalization, effectively negating these gains in
	spatial resolution higher than about 10 mm 3 . Reliable detection
	of activation in single subjects at high resolution is becoming a
	more common desire among fMRI researchers who are interested in comparing
	individuals rather than populations. Since TSNR decreases with voxel
	volume, detection of activation at higher resolutions requires longer
	scan durations. The relationship between TSNR, voxel volume and detectability
	is highly non-linear. In this study, the relationship between TSNR
	and the necessary fMRI scan duration required to obtain significant
	results at varying P values is determined both experimentally and
	theoretically. The results demonstrate that, with a TSNR of 50, detection
	of activation of above 2% requires at most 350 scan volumes (when
	steps are taken to remove the influence of physiological noise from
	the data). Importantly, these results also demonstrate that, for
	activation magnitude on the order of 1%, the scan duration required
	is more sensitive to the TSNR level than at 2%. This study showed
	that with voxel volumes of  10 mm 3 at 3 T, and a corresponding TSNR
	of  50, the required number of time points that guarantees detection
	of signal changes of 1% is about 860, but if TSNR increases by only
	20%, the time for detection decreases by more than 30%. More than
	just being an exercise in numbers, these results imply that imaging
	of columnar resolution (effect size = 1% and assuming a TR of 1 s)
	at 3 T will require either 10 min for a TSNR of 60 or 40 min for
	a TSNR of 30. The implication is that at these resolutions, TSNR
	is likely to be critical for determining success or failure of an
	experiment.},

  abstract = {{ Functional connectivity-based analysis of functional magnetic resonance
	imaging data (fMRI) is an emerging technique for human brain mapping.
	One powerful method for the investigation of functional connectivity
	is independent component analysis (ICA) of concatenated data. However,
	this research field is evolving toward processing increasingly larger
	database taking into account inter-individual variability. Concatenated
	data analysis only handles these features using some additional procedures
	such as bootstrap or including a model of between-subject variability
	during the preprocessing step of the ICA. In order to alleviate these
	limitations, we propose a method based on group analysis of individual
	ICA components, using a multi-scale clustering (MICCA). MICCA start
	with two steps repeated several times: 1) single subject data ICA
	followed by 2) clustering of all subject independent components according
	to a spatial similarity criterion. A final third step consists in
	selecting reproducible clusters across the repetitions of the two
	previous steps. The core of the innovation lies in the multi-scale
	and unsupervised clustering algorithm built as a chain of three processes:
	robust proto-cluster creation, aggregation of the proto-clusters,
	and cluster consolidation. We applied MICCA to the analysis of 310
	fMRI resting state dataset. MICCA identified 28 resting state brain
	networks. Overall, the cluster neuroanatomical substrate included
	98\% of the cerebrum gray matter. MICCA results proved to be reproducible
	in a random splitting of the data sample and more robust than the
	classical concatenation method. }},

  abstract = {Systematic differences in functional connectivity MRI metrics have
	been consistently observed in autism, with predominantly decreased
	cortico-cortical connectivity. Previous attempts at single subject
	classification in high-functioning autism using whole brain point-to-point
	functional connectivity have yielded about 80% accurate classification
	of autism vs. control subjects across a wide age range. We attempted
	to replicate the method and results using the Autism Brain Imaging
	Data Exchange (ABIDE) including resting state fMRI data obtained
	from 964 subjects and 16 separate international sites. For each of
	964 subjects, we obtained pairwise functional connectivity measurements
	from a lattice of 7266 regions of interest covering the gray matter
	(26.4 million "connections") after preprocessing that included motion
	and slice timing correction, coregistration to an anatomic image,
	normalization to standard space, and voxelwise removal by regression
	of motion parameters, soft tissue, CSF, and white matter signals.
	Connections were grouped into multiple bins, and a leave-one-out
	classifier was evaluated on connections comprising each set of bins.
	Age, age-squared, gender, handedness, and site were included as covariates
	for the classifier. Classification accuracy significantly outperformed
	chance but was much lower for multisite prediction than for previous
	single site results. As high as 60% accuracy was obtained for whole
	brain classification, with the best accuracy from connections involving
	regions of the default mode network, parahippocampaland fusiform
	gyri, insula, Wernicke Area, and intraparietal sulcus. The classifier
	score was related to symptom severity, social function, daily living
	skills, and verbal IQ. Classification accuracy was significantly
	higher for sites with longer BOLD imaging times. Multisite functional
	connectivity classification of autism outperformed chance using a
	simple leave-one-out classifier, but exhibited poorer accuracy than
	for single site results. Attempts to use multisite classifiers will
	likely require improved classification algorithms, longer BOLD imaging
	times, and standardized acquisition parameters for possible future

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND: To what extent is activity of individual neurons coupled
	to the local field potential (LFP) and to blood-oxygenation-level
	dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)? This
	issue is of high significance for understanding brain function and
	for relating animal studies to fMRI, yet it is still under debate.
	RESULTS: Here we report data from simultaneous recordings of isolated
	unit activity and LFP by using multiple electrodes in the human auditory
	cortex. We found a wide range of coupling levels between the activity
	of individual neurons and gamma LFP. However, this large variability
	could be predominantly explained (r = 0.66) by the degree of firing-rate
	correlations between neighboring neurons. Importantly, this phenomenon
	occurred during both sensory stimulation and spontaneous activity.
	Concerning the coupling of neuronal activity to BOLD fMRI, we found
	that gamma LFP was well coupled to BOLD measured across different
	individuals (r = 0.62). By contrast, the coupling of single units
	to BOLD was highly variable and, again, tightly related to interneuronal-firing-rate
	correlations (r = 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: Our results offer a resolution
	to a central controversy regarding the coupling between neurons,
	LFP, and BOLD signals by demonstrating, for the first time, that
	the coupling of single units to the other measures is variable yet
	it is tightly related to the degree of interneuronal correlations
	in the human auditory cortex.}},

	firing rates and in gamma (40-100 Hz) LFP power modulations. Notably,

  abstract = {{Motion correction of fMRI data is a widely used step prior to data
	analysis. In this study, a comparison of the motion correction tools
	provided by several leading fMRI analysis software packages was performed,
	including AFNI, AIR, BrainVoyager, FSL, and SPM2. Comparisons were
	performed using data from typical human studies as well as phantom
	data. The identical reconstruction, preprocessing, and analysis steps
	were used on every data set, except that motion correction was performed
	using various configurations from each software package. Each package
	was studied using default parameters, as well as parameters optimized
	for speed and accuracy. Forty subjects performed a Go/No-go task
	(an event-related design that investigates inhibitory motor response)
	and an N-back task (a block-design paradigm investigating working
	memory). The human data were analyzed by extracting a set of general
	linear model (GLM)-derived activation results and comparing the effect
	of motion correction on thresholded activation cluster size and maximum
	t value. In addition, a series of simulated phantom data sets were
	created with known activation locations, magnitudes, and realistic
	motion. Results from the phantom data indicate that AFNI and SPM2
	yield the most accurate motion estimation parameters, while AFNI's
	interpolation algorithm introduces the least smoothing. AFNI is also
	the fastest of the packages tested. However, these advantages did
	not produce noticeably better activation results in motion-corrected
	data from typical human fMRI experiments. Although differences in
	performance between packages were apparent in the human data, no
	single software package produced dramatically better results than
	the others. The '' accurate'' parameters showed virtually no improvement
	in cluster t values compared to the standard parameters. While the
	'' fast'' parameters did not result in a substantial increase in
	speed, they did not degrade the cluster results very much either.
	The phantom and human data indicate that motion correction can be
	a valuable step in the data processing chain, yielding improvements
	of up to 20\% in the magnitude and up to 100\% in the cluster size
	of detected activations, but the choice of software package does
	not substantially affect this improvement.}},

  abstract = {{Analyzing the dependencies between spike trains is an important step
	in understanding how neurons work in concert to represent biological
	signals. Usually this is done for pairs of neurons at a time using
	correlation-based techniques. Chornoboy, Schramm, and Karr (1988)
	proposed maximum likelihood methods for the simultaneous analysis
	of multiple pair-wise interactions among an ensemble of neurons.
	One of these methods is an iterative, continuous-time estimation
	algorithm for a network likelihood model formulated in terms of multiplicative
	conditional intensity functions. We devised a discrete-time version
	of this algorithm that includes a new, efficient computational strategy,
	a principled method to compute starting values, and a principled
	stopping criterion. In an analysis of simulated neural spike trains
	from ensembles of interacting neurons, the algorithm recovered the
	correct connectivity matrices and interaction parameters. In the
	analysis of spike trains from an ensemble of rat hippocampal place
	cells, the algorithm identified a connectivity matrix and interaction
	parameters consistent with the pattern of conjoined firing predicted
	by the overlap of the neurons' spatial receptive fields. These results
	suggest that the network likelihood model can be an efficient tool
	for the analysis of ensemble spiking activity.}},

	The user interface contains all the workflow facilities expected
	by consumers. Using the Eclipse Extension Mechanism designers are
	encouraged to customize CamBAfx for their own pipelines. CamBAfx
	wraps a workflow facility around neuroinformatics software without
	modification. CamBAfx's design, licensing and Eclipse Branding Mechanism
	allow it to be used as the user interface for other software, facilitating

	bibliographic searches of MEDLINE, PsychLit, EMBASE, and BIOSIS using
	search terms sensitive to studies of etiology combined with searches
	on terms related to depression and AD and reviewed reference lists
	of articles. Study Selection Studies with data contrasting depressed
	vs nondepressed patients who did and did not later develop AD were
	included. Studies that related continuous measures of depression
	and cognitive status were excluded. Data Extraction Numerical data
	were independently extracted by 3 reviewers. They also rated studies
	on a scale that assessed quality indicators for observational studies.
	Data on the interval between observation of depression and the diagnosis
	of AD were collected when available. Data Synthesis Meta-analytic
	evaluation with random-effects models resulted in pooled odds ratios
	of 2.03 (95\% confidence interval, 1.73-2.38) for case-control and
	of 1.90 (95\% confidence interval, 1.55-2.33) for cohort studies.
	Findings of increased risk were robust to sensitivity analyses. Interval
	between diagnoses of depression and AD was positively related to
	increased risk of developing AD, suggesting that rather than a prodrome,
	depression may be a risk factor for AD. Conclusions A history of
	depression may confer an increased risk for later developing AD.
	This relation may reflect an independent risk factor for the disease.

	131 consecutive memory-clinic outpatients with newly-diagnosed amnestic-MCI
	(mean age 70.8, SD=6.5). Psychiatric disorders were diagnosed at
	baseline according to the criteria for depression and apathy in AD.
	Neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed with the Neuropsychiatric
	Inventory (NPI). Follow-up examinations were conducted after six
	months and annually for four years. Neurologists diagnosed AD at
	follow-up using NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. Cox proportional hazard models
	with 95\% confidence intervals were used to test the hypothesis that
	apathy or depression increases the risk of developing AD. At baseline,
	36.6\% amnestic-MCI patients had a diagnosis of depression and 10.7\%
	had apathy. Patients with both amnestic-MCI and an apathy diagnosis
	had an almost sevenfold risk of AD progression compared to amnestic-MCI

	30\% per point on the NPI apathy item (HR=1.3; 1.1-1.4). There was
	no increased risk of developing AD in amnestic-MCI patients with

	demonstrated several regions of hypo- and hyper-activation during
	voluntary movement. How these patterns of amplitude changes at multiple
	discrete foci relate to changes within functional networks recruited
	by a given task is unclear. Changes in both amplitude and connectivity
	have both been individually shown within the striato-thalamo-cortical
	(STC) loop in PD, as well as other regions, most consistently in
	the cerebellum and primary motor cortex. We have previously shown
	overactivation of the cerebellum and motor cortex in PD subjects
	off medication during a visuo-motor tracking task performed at three
	frequencies. Here, we show that this change in activation amplitude
	is also accompanied by significant changes in functional connectivity
	between regions of interest (ROIs), with enhanced connectivity within
	the cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) loop as well as increased inter-hemispheric
	communication between several basal ganglia structures. Although
	changes in activation amplitude were influenced by the frequency
	of movement performed in the tracking task, functional connectivity
	changes were robustly present across all three task frequencies performed,
	suggesting that functional connectivity analysis in PD may be a more
	sensitive means of detecting plastic changes which are relatively
	invariant to the particulars of the experimental task. Additionally,
	we demonstrate amplitude and connectivity changes in structures that
	are typically active during the resting state, or "default-mode,"
	in PD. Unlike in STC/CTC loops, where the direction of change was
	the same for amplitude and connectivity, default-mode regions showed
	increased amplitude but decreased connectivity. Our results further
	support that the CTC is recruited in PD to compensate for dysfunctional
	basal ganglia circuits, and that this recruitment involves both amplitude
	and connectivity changes. The differing relationship between amplitude
	and connectivity changes within individual loops highlights the importance
	of jointly examining them in order to fully elucidate functional
	changes in Parkinson's disease. Copyright 2010 IBRO. Published by

  abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new skull stripping method for T1-weighted
	magnetic resonance (MR) brain images. Skull stripping has played
	an important role in neuroimage research because it is a basic preliminary
	step in many clinical applications. The process of skull stripping
	can be challenging due to the complexity of the human brain, variable
	parameters of MR scanners, individual characteristics, etc. In this
	paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient and robust method.
	In the proposed algorithm, after eliminating the background voxels
	with histogram analysis, two seed regions of the brain and non-brain
	regions were automatically identified using a mask produced by morphological
	operations. Then we expanded these seed regions with a 2D region
	growing algorithm based on general brain anatomy information. The
	proposed algorithm was validated using 56 volumes of human brain
	data and simulated phantom data with manually segmented masks. It
	was compared with two popular automated skull stripping methods:
	the brain surface extractor (BSE) and the brain extraction tool (BET).
	The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm produced
	accurate and stable results against data sets acquired from various
	MR scanners and effectively addressed difficult problems such as
	low contrast and large anatomical connections between the brain and
	surrounding tissues. The proposed method was also robust against
	noise, RF, and intensity inhomogeneities.}},

	"speaker" (same or different speaker) and "sentence" (same or different
	sentences). Connectivity studies allow us to ask how spatially remote
	brain regions are neurophysiologically related given these stimuli.
	In the context of this study, we examined how the "speaker" effect
	and "sentence" effect influenced these relationships. We applied
	a Bayesian connectivity method that determines hierarchical functional
	networks of functionally connected brain regions. Hierarchy in these
	functional networks is determined by conditional probabilities of
	elevated activity. For example, a brain region that becomes active
	a superset of the time of another region is considered ascendant
	to that brain region in the hierarchical network. For each factor
	level, we found a baseline functional network connecting the primary
	auditory cortex (Brodmann's Area [BA] 41) with the BA 42 and BA 22
	of the superior temporal gyrus (STG). We also found a baseline functional
	network that includes Wernicke's Area (BA 22 posterior), STG, and
	BA 44 for each factor level. However, we additionally observed a
	strong ascendant connection from BA 41 to the posterior cingulate
	(BA 30) and Broca's Area and a stronger connection from Wernicke's
	Area to STG and the posterior cingulate while passively listening
	to different sentences rather than the same sentence repeatedly.
	Finally, our results revealed no significant "speaker" effect or

	haptic shape perception, with a view to potentially clarifying the
	role of top-down and bottom-up inputs into visual areas. Subjects
	underwent fMRI scanning while engaging in discrimination of haptic
	shape or texture, and in separate runs, visual shape or texture.
	Accuracy did not differ significantly between tasks. Haptic shape-selective
	regions, identified on a contrast between the haptic shape and texture
	conditions in individual subjects, were found bilaterally in the
	postcentral sulcus (PCS), multiple parts of the intraparietal sulcus
	(IPS) and the lateral occipital complex (LOC). The IPS and LOC foci
	tended to be shape-selective in the visual modality as well. Structural
	equation modelling was used to study the effective connectivity among
	the haptic shape-selective regions in the left hemisphere, contralateral
	to the stimulated hand. All possible models were tested for their
	fit to the correlations among the observed time-courses of activity.
	Two equivalent models emerged as the winners. These models, which
	were quite similar, were characterized by both bottom-up paths from
	the PCS to parts of the IPS, and top-down paths from the LOC and
	parts of the IPS to the PCS. We conclude that interactions between

	Whether this fatigue-related decoupling influence on the motor cortical

	functional connectivity (FC) of low-frequency oscillations of resting-state

	to achieve structured noise reduction and improve any subsequent
	detection and analysis of signal fluctuations related to neural activity.
	We propose a new automatic method called CORSICA (CORrection of Structured

	on the spatial localization of the main physiological fluctuations
	in fMRI data. As opposed to existing spectral priors, which may be
	subject to aliasing effects for long-TR data sets (typically acquired
	with TR >1 s), such spatial priors can be applied to fMRI data, regardless
	of the TR of the acquisitions. By comparing the proposed automatic
	selection to a manual selection performed visually by a human operator,
	we first show that CORSICA is able to identify the noise-related
	components for long-TR data with a high sensitivity and a specificity
	of 1. On short-TR data sets, we validate that the proposed method

	group results with the individual ones. This approach, called NEDICA
	(network detection using ICA), was applied on resting-state data

	seven functional networks that were very representative of the population

	a specific connection profile to create parcellations of the cortical

	in two steps. First, the cortical mantle is split at a macroscopic
	level into 36 large gyri using a sulcus recognition system. Then,
	for each voxel of the cortex, a connection profile is computed using
	a probabilistic tractography framework. The tractography is performed

	are inferred from the q-balls using a sharpening process focusing
	the weight around the q-ball local maxima. A sophisticated mask of
	propagation computed from a T1-weighted image perfectly aligned with
	the diffusion data prevents the particles from crossing the cortical
	folds. During propagation, the particles father child particles in
	order to improve the sampling of the long fascicles. For each voxel,
	intersection of the particle trajectories with the gyri lead to a
	connectivity profile made up of only 36 connection strengths. These
	profiles are clustered on a gyrus by gyrus basis using a K-means
	approach including spatial regularization. The reproducibility of

	OBJECTIVE: To characterize cross-sectionally and longitudinally clinical
	measures in normal controls, subjects with MCI, and subjects with
	mild Alzheimer disease (AD) to enable the assessment of the utility
	of neuroimaging and chemical biomarker measures. METHODS: A total
	of 819 subjects (229 cognitively normal, 398 with MCI, and 192 with
	AD) were enrolled at baseline and followed for 12 months using standard
	cognitive and functional measures typical of clinical trials. RESULTS:
	The subjects with MCI were more memory impaired than the cognitively
	normal subjects but not as impaired as the subjects with AD. Nonmemory
	cognitive measures were only minimally impaired in the subjects with
	MCI. The subjects with MCI progressed to dementia in 12 months at
	a rate of 16.5\% per year. Approximately 50\% of the subjects with
	MCI were on antidementia therapies. There was minimal movement on
	the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale for the
	normal control subjects, slight movement for the subjects with MCI
	of 1.1, and a modest change for the subjects with AD of 4.3. Baseline
	CSF measures of Abeta-42 separated the 3 groups as expected and successfully
	predicted the 12-month change in cognitive measures. CONCLUSION:
	The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative has successfully
	recruited cohorts of cognitively normal subjects, subjects with mild
	cognitive impairment (MCI), and subjects with Alzheimer disease with
	anticipated baseline characteristics. The 12-month progression rate
	of MCI was as predicted, and the CSF measures heralded progression

	Design A prospective, longitudinal inception cohort. Setting General

	and 106 patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD), all from a community
	setting as part of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Center/Alzheimer's

	The 3 groups of individuals were compared on demographic factors
	and measures of cognitive function including the Mini-Mental State
	Examination, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, Wechsler
	Memory Scale-Revised, Dementia Rating Scale, Free and Cued Selective
	Reminding Test, and Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Clinical classifications
	of dementia and AD were determined according to the Diagnostic and
	Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition and
	the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders
	and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association
	criteria, respectively. Results The primary distinction between control
	subjects and subjects with MCI was in the area of memory, while other
	cognitive functions were comparable. However, when the subjects with
	MCI were compared with the patients with very mild AD, memory performance
	was similar, but patients with AD were more impaired in other cognitive
	domains as well. Longitudinal performance demonstrated that the subjects
	with MCI declined at a rate greater than that of the controls but
	less rapidly than the patients with mild AD. Conclusions Patients
	who meet the criteria for MCI can be differentiated from healthy
	control subjects and those with very mild AD. They appear to constitute
	a clinical entity that can be characterized for treatment interventions.}},

	(SZ) are related to aberrant, or 'dys-', connectivity between distinct
	brain regions. A proliferation of functional and structural neuroimaging
	studies have been conducted to investigate this hypothesis, across
	the full course of the disorder; from people at Ultra-High-Risk of
	developing psychosis to patients with chronic SZ. However the results
	of these studies have not always been consistent, and to date, there
	have been no attempts to summarise the results of both methodologies
	in conjunction. In this article, we systematically review both the
	structural and functional connectivity literature in SZ. The main
	trends to emerge are that schizophrenia is associated with connectivity
	reductions, as opposed to increases, relative to healthy controls,
	and that this is particularly evident in the connections involving
	the frontal lobe. These two trends appear to apply across all stages
	of the disorder, and to be independent of the neuroimaging methodology
	employed. We discuss the potential implications of these trends,

  abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is a major tool for
	the evaluation of brain function and architecture. It is widely used
	by physicians, neuroscientists, psychologists and others. In order
	to process the data collected using FMRI, it is necessary to use
	post-acquisition processing software that employs motion correction
	and statistical modeling capabilities. These types of programs permit
	the user to extract the information about areas of brain activations
	that have occurred during a study. How well a particular motion-correction
	technique works and what effect it has on statistical processing
	are difficult to evaluate, since the level of activation present
	is not known a priori. This paper provides a description of the construction
	of a software phantom for use with FMRI post-acquisition processing
	tools with the properties that it is based on real subject data,
	has known locations and levels of activation, has known amounts of
	rigid body motion and noise added, and can be used to evaluate a
	processing system as if it were a real data set. Versions of the
	software phantom are available for downloading at the website: .}},

  abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in old
	age, and is characterized by prominent impairment of episodic memory.
	Recent functional imaging studies in AD have demonstrated alterations
	in a distributed network of brain regions supporting memory function,
	including regions of the default mode network. Previous positron
	emission tomography studies of older individuals at risk for AD have
	revealed hypometabolism of association cortical regions similar to
	the metabolic abnormalities seen in AD patients. In recent functional
	magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of AD, corresponding brain
	default mode regions have also been found to demonstrate an abnormal
	fMRI task-induced deactivation response pattern. That is, the relative
	decreases in fMRI signal normally observed in the default mode regions
	in healthy subjects performing a cognitive task are not seen in AD
	patients, or may even be reversed to a paradoxical activation response.
	Our recent studies have revealed alterations in the pattern of deactivation
	also in elderly individuals at risk for AD by virtue of their APOE
	e4 genotype, or evidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In agreement
	with recent reports from other groups, these studies demonstrate
	that the pattern of fMRI task-induced deactivation is progressively
	disrupted along the continuum from normal aging to MCI and to clinical
	AD and more impaired in e4 carriers compared to non-carriers. These
	findings will be discussed in the context of current literature regarding
	functional imaging of the default network in AD and at-risk populations.}},

	most informed one. The process of consulting "several experts" before
	making a final decision is perhaps second nature to us; yet, the
	extensive benefits of such a process in automated decision making
	applications have only recently been discovered by computational

	results compared to those of single-expert systems for a broad range
	of applications and under a variety of scenarios. Design, implementation
	and application of such systems are the main topics of this article.
	Specifically, this paper reviews conditions under which ensemble
	based systems may be more beneficial than their single classifier
	counterparts, algorithms for generating individual components of
	the ensemble systems, and various procedures through which the individual
	classifiers can be combined. We discuss popular ensemble based algorithms,

	hierarchical mixture of experts; as well as commonly used combination
	rules, including algebraic combination of outputs, voting based techniques,
	behavior knowledge space, and decision templates. Finally, we look
	at current and future research directions for novel applications
	of ensemble systems. Such applications include incremental learning,

	estimation, and error correcting output codes; all areas in which

  abstract = {{This paper investigates different choices of test statistic null
	distribution for resampling-based multiple testing in the context
	of single parameter hypotheses. We show that the test statistic null
	distribution for strongly controlling type I error may be obtained
	by projecting the true test statistic distribution onto the space
	of mean zero distributions. For common choices of test statistics,
	this distribution is asymptotically multivariate normal with the
	covariance of the vector influence curve for the parameter estimator.
	Applying the ordinary non-parametric or model-based bootstrap to
	mean zero centered test statistics produces an estimated test statistic
	null distribution which provides asymptotic strong control. In contrast,
	the usual practice of obtaining an estimated test statistic null
	distribution via an estimated data null distribution (e.g. null restricted
	bootstrap) only provides an asymptotically correct test statistic
	null distribution if the covariance of the vector influence curve
	is the same under the chosen data null distribution as under the
	true data distribution. This condition is the formal analogue of
	the subset pivotality condition (Westfall and Young, Resampling-based
	Multiple Testing: Examples and Methods for p-value adjustment, Wiley,
	New York, 1993). We demonstrate the use of our proposed ordinary
	bootstrap null distribution with a single-step multiple testing method
	which is equivalent to constructing an error-specific confidence
	region for the true parameter and checking if it contains the hypothesized
	value. We also study the two sample problem and show that the permutation
	method produces an asymptotically correct null distribution if (i)
	the sample sizes are equal or (ii) the populations have the same
	covariance structure. {\copyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

	on several public gene expression datasets, we evaluate the homogeneity

	used to analyze the performance of several known clustering algorithms.
	A comparative study of these algorithms reveals that their "best
	solutions" are ranked almost oppositely when using different distance
	measures, despite the found correspondence between these measures

	an invaluable tool for assessing the functional organization of the
	human brain in vivo. Due to its widespread application in neuroscience,
	functional neuroimaging has raised the interest of clinical researchers
	in its possible use as a diagnostic biomarker. A hallmark feature
	of many neurodegenerative diseases is their chronic non-linear dynamic
	and highly complex preclinical course. Neurodegenerative diseases
	unfold over years to decades through clinically silent and asymptomatic
	stages of early adaptive, compensatory to pathophysiological (i.e.
	actively neurodegenerative) and decompensatory mechanisms in the
	brain -- phases that are increasingly being considered as critical
	for primary and secondary preventive and therapeutic measures. Emerging
	evidence supports the concept of a potentially fully reversible functional
	phase that may precede the onset of micro- and macrostructural and
	cognitive decline, a potentially late-stage '' neurodegenerative''
	phase of a primary neurodegenerative disorder. Alzheimer's disease
	serves as an ideal model to test this hypothesis supported by the
	neural network model of the healthy and diseased brain. Being highly
	dynamic in nature, brain activation and neuronal network functional
	connectivity represent not only candidate diagnostic but also candidate
	surrogate markers for interventional trials. Potential caveats of
	functional imaging are critically reviewed with focus on confound
	variables such as altered neurovascular coupling as well as parameters
	related to task- and study design. \^{a}º Functional neuroimaging
	captures non-linear states of brain function. \^{a}º Functional
	dynamic markers of default mode and memory networks show promising
	diagnostic accuracy in the detection of AD. \^{a}º Functional dynamic

	load of a preceding working-memory task. Twenty-five healthy subjects
	were investigated with functional MRI at 3 Tesla while performing
	a working-memory task with embedded short resting phases. Data were
	decomposed into statistically independent spatio-temporal components
	using Tensor Independent Component Analysis (TICA). The DMN was selected
	using a template-matching procedure. The spatial map contained rest-related
	activations in the medial frontal cortex, ventral anterior and posterior
	cingulate cortex. The time course of the DMN revealed increased activation
	at rest after 1-back and 2-back blocks compared to the activation
	after a 0-back block. We present evidence that a cognitively challenging
	working-memory task is followed by greater activation of the DMN
	than a simple letter-matching task. This might be interpreted as
	a functional correlate of self-evaluation and reflection of the preceding
	task or as relocation of cerebral resources representing recovery
	from high cognitive demands. This finding is highly relevant for
	neuroimaging studies which include resting phases in cognitive tasks
	as stable baseline conditions. Further studies investigating the
	DMN should take possible interactions of tasks and subsequent resting
	phases into account.}},

	its practical interest at the individual level, especially with regards
	to the capacity of anatomical magnetic resonance imaging to disentangle
	the confounding role of the cognitive reserve in the early diagnosis
	of Alzheimer's disease. One hundred and thirty healthy controls,
	122 subjects with mild cognitive impairment of the amnestic type
	and 130 Alzheimer's disease patients were included from the ADNI
	database and followed up for 24 months. After 24 months, 72 amnestic
	mild cognitive impairment had converted to Alzheimer's disease (referred
	to as progressive mild cognitive impairment, as opposed to stable
	mild cognitive impairment). For each subject, cortical thickness
	was measured on the baseline magnetic resonance imaging volume. The
	resulting cortical thickness map was parcellated into 22 regions
	and a normalized thickness index was computed using the subset of
	regions (right medial temporal, left lateral temporal, right posterior
	cingulate) that optimally distinguished stable mild cognitive impairment
	from progressive mild cognitive impairment. We tested the ability
	of baseline normalized thickness index to predict evolution from
	amnestic mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease and compared
	it to the predictive values of the main cognitive scores at baseline.
	In addition, we studied the relationship between the normalized thickness
	index, the education level and the timeline of conversion to Alzheimer's
	disease. Normalized thickness index at baseline differed significantly
	among all the four diagnosis groups (P < 0.001) and correctly distinguished
	Alzheimer's disease patients from healthy controls with an 85\% cross-validated
	accuracy. Normalized thickness index also correctly predicted evolution
	to Alzheimer's disease for 76\% of amnestic mild cognitive impairment
	subjects after cross-validation, thus showing an advantage over cognitive
	scores (range 63-72\%). Moreover, progressive mild cognitive impairment
	subjects, who converted later than 1 year after baseline, showed
	a significantly higher education level than those who converted earlier
	than 1 year after baseline. Using a normalized thickness index-based
	criterion may help with early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at

	Fast imaging techniques used to measure patterns of population activity
	record movies with many pixels and many frames, i.e., data sets with

	analysis (PCA) followed by spatial independent component analysis
	(sICA), can be exploited to reduce the dimensionality of data sets
	recorded in the olfactory bulb and the somatosensory cortex of mice
	as well as the visual cortex of monkeys, without loosing the stimulus-specific
	responses. Different neuronal populations are separated based on
	their stimulus-specific spatiotemporal activation. Both, spatial
	and temporal response characteristics can be objectively obtained,
	simultaneously. In the olfactory bulb, groups of glomeruli with different
	response latencies can be identified. This is shown for recordings
	of olfactory receptor neuron input measured with a calcium-sensitive
	axon tracer and for network dynamics measured with the voltage-sensitive
	dye RH 1838. In the somatosensory cortex, barrels responding to the
	stimulation of single whiskers can be automatically detected. In
	the visual cortex orientation columns can be extracted. In all cases
	artifacts due to movement, heartbeat or respiration were separated
	from the functional signal by sICA and could be removed from the

	The magnitude of the change depended on the current strength. The

	The spatial extent of brain activations and effects of various changes

	model was proposed to explain the continuous dynamics of electrical
	and vascular states within a cortical unit. These states produce
	certain mesoscopic reflections whose discrete time series can be
	reconstructed from electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI). In this article we develop a recursive
	optimization algorithm based on the local linearization (LL) filter
	and an innovation method to make statistical inferences about the
	LEVC model from both EEG and fMRI data, i.e., to estimate the unobserved
	states and the unknown parameters of the model. For a better understanding,
	the LL filter is described from a Bayesian point of view, providing
	the particulars for the case of hybrid data (e.g., EEG and fMRI),
	which could be sampled at different rates. The dynamics of the exogenous
	synaptic inputs going into the cortical unit are also estimated by
	introducing a set of Gaussian radial basis functions. In order to
	study the dynamics of the electrical and vascular states in the striate
	cortex of humans as well as their local interrelationships, we applied
	this algorithm to EEG and fMRI recordings obtained concurrently from
	two subjects while passively observing a radial checkerboard with
	a white/black pattern reversal. The EEG and fMRI data from the first
	subject was used to estimate the electrical/vascular states and parameters
	of the LEVC model in V1 for a 4.0 Hz reversion frequency. We used
	the EEG data from the second subject to investigate the changes in
	the dynamics of the electrical states when the frequency of reversion
	is varied from 0.5-4.0 Hz. Then we made use of the estimated electrical

	The model was obtained from coupling a canonical neuronal mass and
	an expandable vasculature. In this proposal, we address several aspects
	related to electroencephalographic and functional magnetic resonance
	imaging data fusion: (1) the impact of the cerebral architecture
	(at different physical levels) on the observations; (2) the physiology
	involved in electrovascular coupling; and (3) energetic considerations
	to gain a better understanding of how the glucose budget is used
	during neuronal activity. The model has three components. The first
	is the canonical neural mass model of three subpopulations of neurons
	that respond to incoming excitatory synaptic inputs. The generation
	of the membrane potentials in the somas of these neurons and the
	electric currents flowing in the neuropil are modeled by this component.
	The second and third components model the electrovascular coupling

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND: In the absence of overt stimuli, the brain shows correlated
	fluctuations in functionally related brain regions. Approximately
	ten largely independent resting state networks (RSNs) showing this
	behaviour have been documented to date. Recent studies have reported
	the existence of an RSN in the basal ganglia - albeit inconsistently
	and without the means to interpret its function. Using two large
	study groups with different resting state conditions and MR protocols,
	the reproducibility of the network across subjects, behavioural conditions
	and acquisition parameters is assessed. Independent Component Analysis
	(ICA), combined with novel analyses of temporal features, is applied
	to establish the basis of signal fluctuations in the network and
	its relation to other RSNs. Reference to prior probabilistic diffusion
	tractography work is used to identify the basal ganglia circuit to
	which these fluctuations correspond. RESULTS: An RSN is identified
	in the basal ganglia and thalamus, comprising the pallidum, putamen,
	subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra, with a projection also
	to the supplementary motor area. Participating nuclei and thalamo-cortical
	connection probabilities allow this network to be identified as the
	motor control circuit of the basal ganglia. The network was reproducibly
	identified across subjects, behavioural conditions (fixation, eyes
	closed), field strength and echo-planar imaging parameters. It shows
	a frequency peak at 0.025 +/- 0.007 Hz and is most similar in spectral
	composition to the Default Mode (DM), a network of regions that is
	more active at rest than during task processing. Frequency features
	allow the network to be classified as an RSN rather than a physiological
	artefact. Fluctuations in this RSN are correlated with those in the
	task-positive fronto-parietal network and anticorrelated with those
	in the DM, whose hemodynamic response it anticipates. CONCLUSION:
	Although the basal ganglia RSN has not been reported in most ICA-based
	studies using a similar methodology, we demonstrate that it is reproducible
	across subjects, common resting state conditions and imaging parameters,
	and show that it corresponds with the motor control circuit. This
	characterisation of the basal ganglia network opens a potential means
	to investigate the motor-related neuropathologies in which the basal
	ganglia are involved.}},

	depict only the average level of engagement of different regions

	information about the degree to which components of large-scale neural
	systems are functionally coupled together to achieve specific tasks.
	In order to better understand how brain regions contribute to functionally
	connected circuits, it is necessary to record activation maps either
	as a function of different conditions, at different times or in different
	subjects. Data obtained under different conditions may then be analyzed
	by a variety of techniques to infer correlations and couplings between
	nodes in networks. Several multivariate statistical methods have
	been adapted and applied to analyze variations within such data.
	An approach of particular interest that is suited to studies of connectivity
	within single subjects makes use of acquisitions of runs of MRI images
	obtained while the brain is in a so-called steady state, either at
	rest (i.e., without any specific stimulus or task) or in a condition
	of continuous activation. Interregional correlations between fluctuations
	of MRI signal potentially reveal functional connectivity. Recent
	studies have established that interregional correlations between
	different components of circuits in each of the visual, language,

	Microstructural parcellation of the human cerebral cortex should
	be made on multiple criteria based on quantitative measurements of
	microstructural variables, such as neuron densities, neurotransmitter
	receptor densities, enzyme densities, etc. Because of the inter-individual
	variations of extent and topography of microstructurally defined
	areas, the final microstructurally defined areas appear as population
	maps. In the functional domain, columns, patches and blobs signifying
	synaptically active parts of the cortex appear as cortical functional
	fields. These fields are the largest functional entities of the cerebral
	cortex according to the cortical field hypothesis. In its strong
	version, the cortical field hypothesis postulates that all neurons
	and synapses within the fields perform a co-operative computation.
	A number of such fields together provide the functional contribution
	of the cerebral cortex. The functional parcellation of the human
	cerebral cortex must be based on field population maps, which after
	intersection analysis appear as functional domains. The major structural-functional
	hypothesis to be examined is whether these functional domains are
	equi-territorial to the microstructurally defined meta-maps. The
	cortical hypothesis predicts that, if two brain tasks make use of
	one or several identical or largely overlapping fields, they cannot
	be performed simultaneously without errors or increases in latency.
	Evidence for such interference is presented. This evidence represents
	a restriction in the parallel processing of the human brain. In the
	posterior part of the brain not only visual cortical areas may qualify
	for parallel processing, but also the somatosensory cortices appear
	to have separate functional streams for the detection of microgeometry

	This crucially depends on the suitability of the temporal assumptions

	Exploratory data analysis techniques such as independent component

	nuclei that contribute to the processing of emotion through interactions
	with other subcortical and cortical structures. While these circuits
	have been studied extensively in animals, human neuroimaging investigations
	of amygdala-based networks have typically considered the amygdala
	as a single structure, which likely masks contributions of individual
	amygdala subdivisions. The present study uses resting state functional
	magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test whether distinct functional
	connectivity patterns, like those observed in animal studies, can
	be detected across three amygdala subdivisions: laterobasal, centromedial,
	and superficial. In a sample of 65 healthy adults, voxelwise regression
	analyses demonstrated positively-predicted ventral and negatively-predicted
	dorsal networks associated with the total amygdala, consistent with
	previous animal and human studies. Investigation of individual amygdala
	subdivisions revealed distinct differences in connectivity patterns
	within the amygdala and throughout the brain. Spontaneous activity
	in the laterobasal subdivision predicted activity in temporal and
	frontal regions, while activity in the centromedial nuclei predicted
	activity primarily in striatum. Activity in the superficial subdivision
	positively predicted activity throughout the limbic lobe. These findings

	of its functional subdivisions. Clustering schemes based on resting-state
	functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data are rapidly emerging
	as non-invasive alternatives to cytoarchitectonic mapping in postmortem
	brains. Here, we propose a novel spatio-temporal probabilistic parcellation
	scheme that overcomes major weaknesses of existing approaches by
	(i) modeling the fMRI time series of a voxel as a von Mises-Fisher
	distribution, which is widely used for clustering high dimensional
	data; (ii) modeling the latent cluster labels as a Markov random
	field, which provides spatial regularization on the cluster labels
	by penalizing neighboring voxels having different cluster labels;
	and (iii) introducing a prior on the number of labels, which helps
	in uncovering the number of clusters automatically from the data.
	Cluster labels and model parameters are estimated by an iterative
	expectation maximization procedure wherein, given the data and current
	estimates of model parameters, the latent cluster labels, are computed
	using \^{I}$\pm$-expansion, a state of the art graph cut, method.
	In turn, given the current estimates of cluster labels, model parameters
	are estimated by maximizing the pseudo log-likelihood. The performance
	of the proposed method is validated using extensive computer simulations.
	Using novel stability analysis we examine the sensitivity of our
	methods to parameter initialization and demonstrate that the method
	is robust to a wide range of initial parameter values. We demonstrate
	the application of our methods by parcellating spatially contiguous
	as well as non-contiguous brain regions at both the individual participant
	and group levels. Notably, our analyses yield new data on the posterior
	boundaries of the supplementary motor area and provide new insights
	into functional organization of the insular cortex. Taken together,
	our findings suggest that our method is a powerful tool for investigating
	functional subdivisions in the human brain.}},

  abstract = {{Most cognitive processes are supported by large networks of brain
	regions. To describe the operation of these networks, it is critical
	to understand how individual areas are functionally connected. Here,
	we establish a statistical framework for studying effective and functional
	brain connectivity, using data obtained with a relatively new neuroimaging
	method, the event-related optical signal (EROS). The novelty of our
	approach is the use of timing information (in the form of lagged
	cross-correlations) in interpreting the connections between areas.
	Interpretation of lagged cross-correlations exploits the combination
	of spatial and temporal resolution provided by EROS. In this paper,
	we apply dynamic factor analysis as a method for testing various
	structural models on the lagged covariance matrices derived from
	the EROS data. We first illustrate the approach by testing a simple
	path model of neural activity propagation from area V1 to V3 in a
	visual stimulation task. We then build more complex structural equation

  abstract = {{We present a novel skull-stripping algorithm based on a hybrid approach
	that combines watershed algorithms and deformable surface models.
	Our method takes advantage of the robustness of the former as well
	as the surface information available to the latter. The algorithm
	first localizes a single white matter voxel in a T1-weighted MRI
	image, and uses it to create a global minimum in the white matter
	before applying a watershed algorithm with a preflooding height.
	The watershed algorithm builds an initial estimate of the brain volume
	based on the three-dimensional connectivity of the white matter.
	This first step is robust, and performs well in the presence of intensity
	nonuniformities and noise, but may erode parts of the cortex that
	abut bright nonbrain structures such as the eye sockets, or may remove
	parts of the cerebellum. To correct these inaccuracies, a surface
	deformation process fits a smooth surface to the masked volume, allowing
	the incorporation of geometric constraints into the skull-stripping
	procedure. A statistical atlas, generated from a set of accurately
	segmented brains, is used to validate and potentially correct the
	segmentation, and the MRI intensity values are locally re-estimated
	at the boundary of the brain. Finally, a high-resolution surface
	deformation is performed that accurately matches the outer boundary
	of the brain, resulting in a robust and automated procedure. Studies
	by our group and others outperform other publicly available skull-stripping
	tools.}},

  abstract = {{ Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-FMRI) holds
	the promise of revealing brain functional connectivity without requiring
	specific tasks targeting particular brain systems. RS-FMRI is being
	used to find differences between populations even when a specific
	candidate target for traditional inferences is lacking. However,
	the problem with RS-FMRI is a lacking definition of what constitutes
	noise and signal. RS-FMRI is easy to acquire but is not easy to analyze
	or draw inferences from. In this commentary we discuss a problem
	that is still treated lightly despite its significant impact on RS-FMRI
	inferences; global signal regression (GSReg), the practice of projecting
	out signal averaged over the entire brain, can change resting-state
	correlations in ways that dramatically alter correlation patterns
	and hence conclusions about brain functional connectedness. Although
	Murphy et al. in 2009 demonstrated that GSReg negatively biases correlations,
	the approach remains in wide use. We revisit this issue to argue
	the problem that GSReg is more than negative bias or the interpretability
	of negative correlations. Its usage can fundamentally alter interregional
	correlations within a group, or their differences between groups.
	We used an illustrative model to clearly convey our objections and
	derived equations formalizing our conclusions. We hope this creates
	a clear context in which counterarguments can be made. We conclude
	that GSReg should not be used when studying RS-FMRI because GSReg
	biases correlations differently in different regions depending on
	the underlying true interregional correlation structure. GSReg can
	alter local and long-range correlations, potentially spreading underlying
	group differences to regions that may never have had any. Conclusions
	also apply to substitutions of GSReg for denoising with decompositions
	of signals aggregated over the network's regions to the extent they
	cannot separate signals of interest from noise. We touch on the need
	for careful accounting of nuisance parameters when making group comparisons
	of correlation maps. }},

	recordings and is found over a wide range of temporal and spatial
	scales. It is characterized by remarkably large spontaneous modulations.
	Here, we review evidence for the functional role of these ongoing
	activity fluctuations and argue that they constitute an essential
	property of the neural architecture underlying cognition. The role
	of spontaneous activity fluctuations is probably best understood
	when considering both their spatiotemporal structure and their functional
	impact on cognition. We first briefly argue against a "segregationist"
	view on ongoing activity, both in time and space, which would selectively
	associate certain frequency bands or levels of spatial organization
	with specific functional roles. Instead, we emphasize the functional
	importance of the full range, from differentiation to integration,
	of intrinsic activity within a hierarchical spatiotemporal structure.
	We then highlight the flexibility and context-sensitivity of intrinsic
	functional connectivity that suggest its involvement in functionally
	relevant information processing. This role in information processing
	is pursued by reviewing how ongoing brain activity interacts with
	afferent and efferent information exchange of the brain with its
	environment. We focus on the relationship between the variability
	of ongoing and evoked brain activity, and review recent reports that
	tie ongoing brain activity fluctuations to variability in human perception
	and behavior. Finally, these observations are discussed within the
	framework of the free-energy principle which - applied to human brain

	It is also shown that the FDR-controlling Benjamini-Liu step-down
	procedure originally developed for independent test statistics works
	even when the test statistics are positively dependent in some sense.
	An explicit expression for the FDR of a generalized stepwise procedure

	An important concept related to connectivity modeling is Granger

	propose the application of the partial directed coherence (PDC) for
	the connectivity analysis of multisubject fMRI data using multivariate
	bootstrap. PDC is a frequency domain counterpart of Granger causality
	and has become a very prominent tool in EEG studies. The achieved
	frequency decomposition of connectivity is useful in separating interactions
	from neural modules from those originating in scanner noise, breath,

	a group-level suffer from the drawback of evaluating single-subject
	resting-state components of interest either using a predefined spatial

	of group ICA methods is based solely on spatially consistency across
	subjects directly reflecting similar networks. Therefore, group data
	can be processed without further visual inspection of the single-subject
	components or the definition of a template (Sch\"{o}pf et al., 2009).
	In this study FENICA was applied to fMRI resting-state data from
	28 healthy subjects resulting in eight group RSNs. These RSNs resemble
	the spatial patterns of the following previously described networks:
	(1) visual network, (2) default mode network, (3) sensorimotor network,
	(4) dorsolateral prefrontal network, (5) temporal prefrontal network,
	(6) basal ganglia network, (7) auditory processing network, and (8)

  abstract = {{Neuroimaging is increasingly used to aid diagnosis in dementia. The
	traditional view that imaging is important solely as means of excluding
	treatable causes of dementia is maintained by many guidelines. These
	conditions however, account for a tiny proportion (<1\%) of all causes
	of dementia. Over the past few years it has been recognised that
	a more accurate diagnosis and prognosis is important for patients
	and their families. The different pathological processes that produce
	cerebral dysfunction at a cellular level also produce macroscopic
	effects that can be detected in vivo with imaging. Clinically useful
	measures that distinguish between neurodegenerative disorders at
	an early stage are still awaited. The most likely future use of structural
	imaging will be the identification of patients at risk for Alzheimer's
	disease or with preclinical Alzheimer's disease. For magnetic resonance
	imaging (MRI) this will mean focusing on those areas that are affected
	earliest in the disease; ie, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, using
	high resolution structural MRI or sophisticated brain mapping techniques.
	Imaging research is also likely to focus on measuring progression
	and detecting therapeutic effect. As such, MRI is already become
	an indispensable tool in clinical trials in dementia.}},

	Concatenating across subjects provided the best overall performance

	We examined the neuropathologic diagnoses, including Alzheimer disease

	the role of specific cortical regions, providing insight into the
	neurophysiological underpinnings of brain function. Scientists developing
	fMRI methodology seek to improve detection of subtle activations
	and to spatially localize these activations more precisely. Except
	for applications in the clinical environment, such as functional
	mapping in patients prior to neurosurgical intervention, most basic
	neuroscience studies involve group level random-effects analyses.
	Prior to grouping data, the data from each individual are typically
	smoothed. A wide range of motivations for smoothing have been given
	including to match the spatial scale of hemodynamic responses, to
	normalize the error distribution (by the Central Limit Theorem) to
	improve the validity of inferences based on parametric tests, and,
	in the context of inter-subject averaging smoothing has been shown
	necessary to project the data down to a scale where homologies in
	functional anatomy are expressed across subjects. This work demonstrates
	that, for single-subject studies, if smoothing is to be employed,
	the data should be acquired at lower resolutions to maximize SNR.
	The benefits of a low-resolution acquisition are limited by partial
	volume effects and by the weak impact of resolution-dependent noise
	on the overall group level statistics. Given that inter-subject noise
	dominates across a range of tasks, improvements in within-subject
	noise, through changes in acquisition strategy or even moving to
	higher field strength, may do little to improve group statistics.
	Such improvements however may greatly impact single-subject studies

  abstract = {{ Summary Abstract Patient-oriented research is defined by the National
	Institutes of Health (NIH) as 'research conducted with human subjects
	(or on material of human origin such as tissues, specimens and cognitive
	phenomena) for which an investigator (or colleague) directly interacts
	with human subjects'. Excluded from this definition are in vitro
	studies that utilize human tissues that cannot be linked to a living
	individual. Subsets of patient-oriented research according to NIH
	include: (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) therapeutic interventions,
	(c) clinical trials, or (d) development of new technologies Therefore,
	patient-oriented research represents a subset of clinical research.
	However, whereas in clinical research studies can involve human cells,
	patient-oriented research requires an intact human being as it focuses
	on the understanding of human physiology as a key to understanding
	the mechanism of disease processes in humans. Through understanding
	the mechanism of human diseases, interventions can then be developed
	to both prevent and treat these diseases. Patient-oriented research
	can be conducted through intervention, direct observation or indirect
	observation, e.g. through use of a database. As a discipline, patient-oriented
	research shares many of the basic principles of the methodology used
	in basic science, animal or in vitro research. In this regard, formulation
	of a sound and reasonable hypothesis is the starting point, followed
	by good study design and rigorous hypothesis testing. However, unique
	to patient-oriented research are a number of special considerations
	which are reviewed in this chapter. }},

  abstract = {{The left angular gyrus (AG) is reliably activated across a wide range
	of semantic tasks, and is also a consistently reported component
	of the so-called default network that it is deactivated during all
	goal-directed tasks. We show here that there is only partial overlap
	between the semantic system and the default network in left AG and
	the overlap defines a reliable functional landmark that can be used
	to segregate functional subdivisions within AG. In 94 healthy human
	subjects, we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
	data during fixation and eight goal directed tasks that involved
	semantic matching, perceptual matching or speech production in response
	to familiar or unfamiliar stimuli presented in either verbal (letters)
	or nonverbal (pictures) formats. Our results segregated three different
	left AG regions that were all activated by semantic relative to perceptual
	matching: (1) a midregion (mAG) that overlapped with the default
	network because it was deactivated during all tasks relative to fixation;
	(2) a dorsomesial region (dAG) that was more activated by all tasks
	relative to fixation; and (3) a ventrolateral region (vAG) that was
	only activated above fixation during semantic matching. By examining
	the effects of task and stimuli in each AG subdivision, we propose
	that mAG is involved in semantic associations regardless of the presence
	or absence of a stimulus; dAG is involved in searching for semantics
	in all visual stimuli, and vAG is involved in the conceptual identification
	of visual inputs. Our findings provide a framework for reporting
	and interpreting AG activations with greater definition.}},

	Despite extensive research in cellular and animal models, identifying

	We extracted soluble amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) oligomers directly

	oligomers potently inhibited long-term potentiation (LTP), enhanced
	long-term depression (LTD) and reduced dendritic spine density in
	normal rodent hippocampus. Soluble Abeta from Alzheimer's disease
	brain also disrupted the memory of a learned behavior in normal rats.
	These various effects were specifically attributable to Abeta dimers.
	Mechanistically, metabotropic glutamate receptors were required for
	the LTD enhancement, and N-methyl D-aspartate receptors were required
	for the spine loss. Co-administering antibodies to the Abeta N-terminus
	prevented the LTP and LTD deficits, whereas antibodies to the midregion
	or C-terminus were less effective. Insoluble amyloid plaque cores
	from Alzheimer's disease cortex did not impair LTP unless they were
	first solubilized to release Abeta dimers, suggesting that plaque
	cores are largely inactive but sequester Abeta dimers that are synaptotoxic.

	procedure for the analysis of PET activation studies. The covariance-based
	multivariate analysis was used to investigate distributed brain systems
	in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients and matched controls
	during performance of a working memory task. The results were compared
	to univariate results obtained in an earlier study. We also examined
	whether the PTSD patients demonstrated a breakdown in functional
	connectivity that may be associated with working memory difficulties
	often experienced by these patients. A resampling procedure was used
	specifically to test the reliability of measured between-group effects,
	to avoid mistaken inference on the basis of random intersubject differences.
	Significant and reproducible differences in network connectivity
	were obtained for the two groups. The functional connectivity pattern
	of the patient group was characterized by relatively more activation
	in the bilateral inferior parietal lobes and the left precentral
	gyrus than the control group, and less activation in the inferior
	medial frontal lobe, bilateral middle frontal gyri and right inferior
	temporal gyrus. The resampling procedure provided direct evidence
	that working memory updating was abnormal in PTSD patients relative
	to matched controls. This work focuses on the need to identify extended
	brain networks (in addition to regionally specific changes) for the
	full characterization of brain responses in neuroimaging experiments.
	Our multivariate analysis explicitly measures the reliability of

	Despite this increasing popularity, concerns about the psychologically

	the patterns of functional connectivity detected are remarkably consistent.
	However, the test-retest reliability for measures of resting state
	fcMRI measures has not been determined. Here, we quantify the test-retest
	reliability, using resting scans from 26 participants at 3 different
	time points. Specifically, we assessed intersession (>5 months apart),
	intrasession (<1 h apart), and multiscan (across all 3 scans) reliability
	and consistency for both region-of-interest and voxel-wise analyses.
	For both approaches, we observed modest to high reliability across
	connections, dependent upon 3 predictive factors: 1) correlation
	significance (significantly nonzero > nonsignificant), 2) correlation
	valence (positive > negative), and 3) network membership (default
	mode > task positive network). Short- and long-term measures of the
	consistency of global connectivity patterns were highly robust. Finally,
	hierarchical clustering solutions were highly reproducible, both
	across participants and sessions. Our findings provide a solid foundation

	is large and is similar to the permutation form of the ordinary log-rank

	to generate a 3960 cell matrix reflecting whole-brain connectivity.
	We trained a classifier to identify specific patterns of whole-brain
	connectivity as subjects rested quietly, remembered the events of
	their day, subtracted numbers, or (silently) sang lyrics. In a leave-one-out
	cross-validation, the classifier identified these 4 cognitive states
	with 84\% accuracy. More critically, the classifier achieved 85\%
	accuracy when identifying these states in a second, independent cohort
	of subjects. Classification accuracy remained high with imaging runs
	as short as 30--60 s. At all temporal intervals assessed, the 90

	is widely assumed to reflect interregional coherence of fluctuations

	tenuous. Through simultaneous fMRI and intracortical neurophysiological

	BOLD signals and concurrent fluctuations in the underlying locally
	measured neuronal activity. This correlation varied with time-lag
	of BOLD relative to neuronal activity, resembling a traditional hemodynamic
	response function with peaks at approximately 6 s lag of BOLD signal.
	The correlations were reliably detected when the neuronal signal
	consisted of either the spiking rate of a small group of neurons,
	or relative power changes in the multi-unit activity band, and particularly
	in the local field potential gamma band. Analysis of correlation

	In this study a direct comparison is made between the power of various

	on optimizing the ratio of the number of detected activations to
	the number of false-positive findings. The main findings are as follows:
	Preprocessing. The removal of intensity drifts and high-pass filtering
	applied on the voxel time-course level is beneficial to the efficacy
	of analysis. Temporal normalization of the global image intensity,
	smoothing in the temporal domain, and low-pass filtering do not improve

	Each state was maintained for 30 s. The average difference between

	does not require an a priori similarity metric, is invariant to changes
	in the representation of the data, and naturally captures nonlinear

  abstract = {{Analysis of fMRI time-series data is usually performed within the
	general linear model (GLM), and conclusions are based on the probability
	(p) of a false-positive voxel. In its simplest form, this process
	assumes that temporal noise in the time-series is random (white);
	if it is not, then an error in the estimation of p will occur. Various
	methods for correcting the problem have been developed, but they
	are not always used. Analysis packages vary in their ability to deal
	with this problem, and there is a lack of consistent advice to non-experts
	concerning whether this issue is serious or is small enough to be
	ignored. The variability of expert opinion partly reflects the fact
	that the magnitude of the error that occurs when estimating p in
	fMRI data is largely undocumented. In this discussion, aimed more
	at "neuroscience users" than methods experts, we try to clarify the
	position by documenting the scale of the error in a simple block-design
	experiment. Based on a fixed-effects group analysis of null datasets
	(8 participants scanned while at rest), we show that the magnitude
	of the problem can be very substantial. Without correction, it was
	necessary to set a nominal probability threshold of about p = 0.000001
	in order to achieve an actual probability of a false positive of
	0.001. This means that if task-related activations were present in
	such a dataset, only if they reached the former, very low nominal
	p value could they be relied upon. With the use of standard correction
	methods, the error was largely removed. Our results suggest that
	some form of pre-whitening or correction for effects of non-white
	noise is essential in single-subject GLM analyses and fixed-effects
	group analyses of fMRI data. It is less important but probably prudent
	to apply a correction at the first level of random-effects group
	analyses. We also evaluate the effect of high-pass filtering. We
	find that the number of false positives in a fixed-effects analysis
	increases markedly as the filter cut-off frequency is increased.
	The sensitivity benefits derived from high-pass filtering may thus
	be partially offset by a significant increase in the number of false
	positives.}},

	Model (SSM), applied to single-subject fMRI data to identify patterns

	well-characterized simple motor task. We hypothesized that each subject
	would exhibit correlated patterns of brain activation in several
	regions known to participate in the regulation of movement including
	the contralateral motor cortex and the ipsilateral cerebellum. EPI
	BOLD images were acquired in six healthy participants as they performed
	a visually and auditorally paced finger opposition task. SSM analysis
	was applied to the fMR time series on a single-subject basis. Linear
	combinations of the major principal components that predicted the
	expected hemodynamic response to the order of experimental conditions
	were identified for each participant. These combinations of SSM patterns
	were highly associated with the expected hemodynamic response, an
	indicator of local neuronal activity, in each participant (0.84 2

	was characterized most prominently by relatively increased activations
	in contralateral sensorimotor cortex and ipsilateral cerebellum.
	Additionally, all subjects showed areas of relatively decreased activation
	in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex and contralateral cerebellum.
	The application of network analysis methods, such as SSM, to single-subject

	brain areas in individual subjects. This approach may help identify

  abstract = {{Optimising the efficiency of an experimental design is known to be
	of great importance. However, existing methods for calculating design
	rank deficiency and contrast estimability (an important aspect of
	experimental design) relate to computational precision rather than
	image noise and are therefore not very meaningful. For example, a
	contrast between two experimental conditions may be mathematically
	"estimable" while requiring a huge differential BOLD response for
	statistical significance to be reached. In this paper we formulate
	standard efficiency equations in terms of required BOLD effect, and
	use this to generate measures of rank/estimability which are meaningful.
	This takes into account the strength and smoothness of the timeseries
	noise and is applicable to complex contrasts; we show how to re-express
	several regressors and an associated contrast vector as a single
	equivalent regressor, so that we can calculate the contrast's effective
	peak-peak height unambiguously. We also present some example results
	on typical designs, and characterise noise results from a range of
	typical FMRI acquisitions, in order to allow experimenters to apply
	efficiency estimation in advance of acquiring data.}},

	in the brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in

	diffusion data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how
	strongly directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging studies
	are starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical analyses,
	in order to localise brain changes related to development, degeneration

	multiple subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be
	drawn from the subsequent voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness
	of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been resolved.
	In this paper, we present a new method that aims to solve these issues
	via (a) carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by (b)
	projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the
	"mean FA skeleton"). We refer to this new approach as Tract-Based

  abstract = {{ There is great interest in estimating brain "networks" from FMRI
	data. This is often attempted by identifying a set of functional
	"nodes" (e.g., spatial ROIs or ICA maps) and then conducting a connectivity
	analysis between the nodes, based on the FMRI timeseries associated
	with the nodes. Analysis methods range from very simple measures
	that consider just two nodes at a time (e.g., correlation between
	two nodes' timeseries) to sophisticated approaches that consider
	all nodes simultaneously and estimate one global network model (e.g.,
	Bayes net models). Many different methods are being used in the literature,
	but almost none has been carefully validated or compared for use
	on FMRI timeseries data. In this work we generate rich, realistic
	simulated FMRI data for a wide range of underlying networks, experimental
	protocols and problematic confounds in the data, in order to compare
	different connectivity estimation approaches. Our results show that
	in general correlation-based approaches can be quite successful,
	methods based on higher-order statistics are less sensitive, and
	lag-based approaches perform very poorly. More specifically: there
	are several methods that can give high sensitivity to network connection
	detection on good quality FMRI data, in particular, partial correlation,
	regularised inverse covariance estimation and several Bayes net methods;
	however, accurate estimation of connection directionality is more
	difficult to achieve, though Patel's τ can be reasonably successful.
	With respect to the various confounds added to the data, the most
	striking result was that the use of functionally inaccurate ROIs
	(when defining the network nodes and extracting their associated
	timeseries) is extremely damaging to network estimation; hence, results
	derived from inappropriate ROI definition (such as via structural
	atlases) should be regarded with great caution. Copyright {\copyright}

  abstract = {{ A potential benefit of profiling of tissue samples using microarrays
	is the generation of molecular fingerprints that will define subtypes
	of disease. Hierarchical clustering has been the primary analytical
	tool used to define disease subtypes from microarray experiments
	in cancer settings. Assessing cluster reliability poses a major complication
	in analyzing output from clustering procedures. While most work has
	focused on estimating the number of clusters in a dataset, the question
	of stability of individual-level clusters has not been addressed.
	We address this problem by developing cluster stability scores using
	subsampling techniques. These scores exploit the redundancy in biologically
	discriminatory information on the chip. Our approach is generic and
	can be used with any clustering method. We propose procedures for
	calculating cluster stability scores for situations involving both
	known and unknown numbers of clusters. We also develop cluster-size
	adjusted stability scores. The method is illustrated by application
	to data three cancer studies; one involving childhood cancers, the
	second involving B-cell lymphoma, and the final is from a malignant
	melanoma study. Code implementing the proposed analytic method can
	be obtained at the second author's website. }},

	It is shown that the detection performance evaluated by the area
	under the receiver operating characteristic curve is directly related
	to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the composite image generated
	in the detection process. 2) Detection and segmentation of activated
	areas are formulated in a vector space framework. In this formulation,
	a linear transformation (image combination method) is shown to be
	desirable to maximize the SNR of the activated areas subject to the
	constraint of removing inactive areas. 3) An analytical solution
	for the problem is found. 4) Image pixel vectors and expected time
	series pattern (signature) for inactive pixels are used to calculate
	weighting vector and identify activated regions. 5) Signatures of
	the activated regions are used to segment different activities. 6)
	Segmented images by the proposed method are compared with those generated
	by the conventional methods (correlation, t-statistic, and z statistic).
	Detection performance and SNRs of the images are compared. The proposed
	approach outperforms the conventional methods of fMRI analysis. In
	addition, it is model-independent and does not require a priori knowledge
	of the fMRI response to the paradigm. Since the method is linear
	and most of the work is done analytically, numerical implementation
	and execution of the method are much faster than the conventional

	in recent years has focused on assessing the reliability of FC across

	in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) has not yet been
	examined in older adults. In this study, we investigated age-related
	differences in reliability and stability of RSFC across scans. In
	addition, we examined how global signal regression (GSR) affects
	RSFC reliability and stability. Three separate resting-state scans
	from 29 younger adults (18-35 yrs) and 26 older adults (55-85 yrs)
	were obtained from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping
	(ICBM) dataset made publically available as part of the 1000 Functional
	Connectomes project www.nitrc.org/projects/fcon\_1000. 92 regions
	of interest (ROIs) with 5 cubic mm radius, derived from the default,
	cingulo-opercular, fronto-parietal and sensorimotor networks, were
	previously defined based on a recent study. Mean time series were
	extracted from each of the 92 ROIs from each scan and three matrices
	of z-transformed correlation coefficients were created for each subject,
	which were then used for evaluation of multi-scan reliability and
	stability. The young group showed higher reliability of RSFC than
	the old group with GSR (p-value = 0.028) and without GSR (p-value
	<0.001). Both groups showed a high degree of multi-scan stability
	of RSFC and no significant differences were found between groups.
	By comparing the test-retest reliability of RSFC with and without
	GSR across scans, we found significantly higher proportion of reliable
	connections in both groups without GSR, but decreased stability.
	Our results suggest that aging is associated with reduced reliability
	of RSFC which itself is highly stable within-subject across scans
	for both groups, and that GSR reduces the overall reliability but
	increases the stability in both age groups and could potentially
	alter group differences of RSFC. }},

  abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that prominently
	affects cerebral connectivity. Assessing the functional connectivity
	at rest, recent functional MRI (fMRI) studies reported on the existence
	of resting-state networks (RSNs). RSNs are characterized by spatially
	coherent, spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level-dependent
	signal and are made up of regional patterns commonly involved in
	functions such as sensory, attention, or default mode processing.
	In AD, the default mode network (DMN) is affected by reduced functional
	connectivity and atrophy. In this work, we analyzed functional and
	structural MRI data from healthy elderly (n = 16) and patients with
	amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) (n = 24), a syndrome of
	high risk for developing AD. Two questions were addressed: (i) Are
	any RSNs altered in aMCI? (ii) Do changes in functional connectivity
	relate to possible structural changes? Independent component analysis
	of resting-state fMRI data identified eight spatially consistent
	RSNs. Only selected areas of the DMN and the executive attention
	network demonstrated reduced network-related activity in the patient
	group. Voxel-based morphometry revealed atrophy in both medial temporal
	lobes (MTL) of the patients. The functional connectivity between
	both hippocampi in the MTLs and the posterior cingulate of the DMN
	was present in healthy controls but absent in patients. We conclude
	that in individuals at risk for AD, a specific subset of RSNs is
	altered, likely representing effects of ongoing early neurodegeneration.
	We interpret our finding as a proof of principle, demonstrating that
	functional brain disorders can be characterized by functional-disconnectivity
	profiles of RSNs.}},

	It turns out that balanced permutation reference distributions do

  abstract = {{ The hallmark clinical symptom of early Alzheimer's disease (AD)
	is episodic memory impairment. Recent functional imaging studies
	suggest that memory function is subserved by a set of distributed
	networks, which include both the medial temporal lobe (MTL) system
	and the set of cortical regions collectively referred to as the default
	network. Specific regions of the default network, in particular,
	the posteromedial cortices, including the precuneus and posterior
	cingulate, are selectively vulnerable to early amyloid deposition
	in AD. These regions are also thought to play a key role in both
	memory encoding and retrieval, and are strongly functionally connected
	to the MTL. Multiple functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
	studies during memory tasks have revealed alterations in these networks
	in patients with clinical AD. Similar functional abnormalities have
	been detected in subjects at-risk for AD, including those with genetic
	risk and older individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Recently,
	we and other groups have found evidence of functional alterations
	in these memory networks even among cognitively intact older individuals
	with occult amyloid pathology, detected by PET amyloid imaging. Taken
	together, these findings suggest that the pathophysiological process
	of AD exerts specific deleterious effects on these distributed memory
	circuits, even prior to clinical manifestations of significant memory
	impairment. Interestingly, some of the functional alterations seen
	in prodromal AD subjects have taken the form of increases in activity
	relative to baseline, rather than a loss of activity. It remains
	unclear whether these increases in fMRI activity may be compensatory
	to maintain memory performance in the setting of early AD pathology
	or instead, represent evidence of excitotoxicity and impending neuronal
	failure. Recent studies have also revealed disruption of the intrinsic
	connectivity of these networks observable even during the resting
	state in early AD and asymptomatic individuals with high amyloid
	burden. Research is ongoing to determine if these early network alterations
	will serve as sensitive predictors of clinical decline, and eventually,
	as markers of pharmacological response to potential disease-modifying
	treatments for AD. }},

  abstract = {{ Many complex and interesting phenomena in nature are due to nonlinear
	phenomena. The theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, also called
	'chaos theory', has now progressed to a stage, where it becomes possible
	to study self-organization and pattern formation in the complex neuronal
	networks of the brain. One approach to nonlinear time series analysis
	consists of reconstructing, from time series of EEG or MEG, an attractor
	of the underlying dynamical system, and characterizing it in terms
	of its dimension (an estimate of the degrees of freedom of the system),
	or its Lyapunov exponents and entropy (reflecting unpredictability
	of the dynamics due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions).
	More recently developed nonlinear measures characterize other features
	of local brain dynamics (forecasting, time asymmetry, determinism)
	or the nonlinear synchronization between recordings from different
	brain regions. Nonlinear time series has been applied to EEG and
	MEG of healthy subjects during no-task resting states, perceptual
	processing, performance of cognitive tasks and different sleep stages.
	Many pathologic states have been examined as well, ranging from toxic
	states, seizures, and psychiatric disorders to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's
	and Cre1utzfeldt-Jakob's disease. Interpretation of these results
	in terms of 'functional sources' and 'functional networks' allows
	the identification of three basic patterns of brain dynamics: (i)
	normal, ongoing dynamics during a no-task, resting state in healthy
	subjects; this state is characterized by a high dimensional complexity
	and a relatively low and fluctuating level of synchronization of
	the neuronal networks; (ii) hypersynchronous, highly nonlinear dynamics
	of epileptic seizures; (iii) dynamics of degenerative encephalopathies
	with an abnormally low level of between area synchronization. Only
	intermediate levels of rapidly fluctuating synchronization, possibly
	due to critical dynamics near a phase transition, are associated
	with normal information processing, whereas both hyper-as well as
	hyposynchronous states result in impaired information processing
	and disturbed consciousness. }},

	is that an appropriate clustering threshold needs to be specified.
	Upon grouping data into a hierarchical tree, clusters are identified
	either by specifying their number or by choosing an appropriate inconsistency
	coefficient. Since the number of clusters present in the data is
	not known beforehand, even a slight variation of the inconsistency
	coefficient can significantly affect the results. To address these
	limitations, the dendrogram sharpening method, combined with a hierarchical
	clustering algorithm, is used in this work to identify modality regions,
	which are, in essence, areas of activation in the human brain during
	an fMRI experiment. The objective of the algorithm is to remove data
	from the low-density regions in order to obtain a clearer representation
	of the data structure. Once cluster cores are identified, the classification
	algorithm is run on voxels, set aside during sharpening, attempting
	to reassign them to the detected groups. When applied to a paced
	motor paradigm, task-related activations in the motor cortex are
	detected. In order to evaluate the performance of the algorithm,
	the obtained clusters are compared to standard activation maps where
	the expected hemodynamic response function is specified as a regressor.
	The obtained patterns of both methods have a high concordance (correlation
	coefficient = 0.91). Furthermore, the dependence of the clustering
	results on the sharpening parameters is investigated and recommendations

	study may require the repeated processing, using computationally
	demanding and complex applications, of thousands of files corresponding
	to hundreds of functional MRI studies. Execution efficiency demands
	the use of parallel or distributed computing, but few medical researchers
	have the time or expertise to write the necessary parallel programs.
	The Swift system addresses these concerns. A simple scripting language,
	SwiftScript, provides for the concise high-level specification of
	workflows that invoke various application programs on potentially
	large quantities of data. The Swift engine provides for the efficient
	execution of these workflows on sequential computers, parallel computers,
	and/or distributed grids that federate the computing resources of
	many sites. Last but not least, the Swift provenance catalog keeps
	track of all actions performed, addressing vital bookkeeping functions
	that so often cause difficulties in large computations. To illustrate
	the use of Swift for medical research, we describe its use for the
	analysis of functional MRI data as part of a research project examining
	the neurological mechanisms of recovery from aphasia after stroke.
	We show how SwiftScript is used to encode an application workflow,

	cognitive task. These changes are thought to represent synchronous
	fluctuations in blood flow, which imply neuronal connections between
	the regions. The purpose of this study was to map functional connectivity
	in subcortical nuclei with functional connectivity functional MR
	imaging. METHODS: Imaging data were acquired with an echo-planar
	sequence from six volunteers who performed no specific cognitive
	task. For functional connectivity functional MR imaging, a "seed"
	voxel or group of voxels was selected from the resting data set in
	the thalamus or in the hippocampus. Control voxels in gray matter
	presumed not to be eloquent cortex were also chosen. The correlation
	coefficient of the seed voxels and the control voxels with every
	other voxel in the resting data set was calculated. The voxels with
	correlation coefficients greater than or equal to 0.5 were mapped
	onto anatomic images for the functional connectivity functional MR
	images. The anatomic location of these voxels was determined by conventional
	parcellation methods. RESULTS: For each participant, functional connectivity
	functional MR imaging maps based on four seed voxels in the thalamus
	or hippocampus showed clusters of voxels in the ipsilateral and contralateral
	thalamus or hippocampus. For control voxels, few voxels in the hippocampus
	or thalamus showed significant correlation. Significantly more pixels
	in the ipsilateral hippocampus correlated with the seed voxel than
	in the contralateral hippocampus. The differences between numbers
	of functionally connected voxels in ipsilateral thalamus and those
	in contralateral thalamus were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The
	thalamus and hippocampus show functional connectivity, presumably
	representing synchronous changes in blood flow.}},

	Using the NPAIRS split-half resampling framework for estimating prediction/reproducibility
	metrics (Strother et al., 2002), we illustrate its use by testing
	the relative importance of selected pipeline components (interpolation,
	in-plane spatial smoothing, temporal detrending, and between-subject
	alignment) in a group analysis of BOLD-fMRI scans from 16 subjects
	performing a block-design, parametric-static-force task. Large-scale
	brain networks were detected using a multivariate linear discriminant
	analysis (canonical variates analysis, CVA) that was tuned to fit
	the data. We found that tuning the CVA model and spatial smoothing
	were the most important processing parameters. Temporal detrending
	was essential to remove low-frequency, reproducing time trends; the
	number of cosine basis functions for detrending was optimized by
	assuming that separate epochs of baseline scans have constant, equal
	means, and this assumption was assessed with prediction metrics.
	Higher-order polynomial warps compared to affine alignment had only
	a minor impact on the performance metrics. We found that both prediction

	provides an alternative to simulations and ROC curves by using real
	PET and fMRI data sets to examine the relationship between prediction
	accuracy and the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) associated with reproducible
	SPMs. Using cross-validation resampling we plot training-test set
	predictions of the experimental design variables (e.g., brain-state
	labels) versus reproducibility SNR metrics for the associated SPMs.
	We demonstrate the utility of this framework across the wide range
	of performance metrics obtained from [15O]water PET studies of 12
	age- and sex-matched data sets performing different motor tasks (8
	subjects/set). For the 12 data sets we apply NPAIRS with both univariate
	and multivariate data-analysis approaches to: (1) demonstrate that
	this framework may be used to obtain reproducible SPMs from any data-analysis
	approach on a common Z-score scale (rSPM{Z}); (2) demonstrate that
	the histogram of a rSPM{Z} image may be modeled as the sum of a data-analysis-dependent
	noise distribution and a task-dependent, Gaussian signal distribution
	that scales monotonically with our reproducibility performance metric;
	(3) explore the relation between prediction and reproducibility performance
	metrics with an emphasis on bias-variance tradeoffs for flexible,
	multivariate models; and (4) measure the broad range of reproducibility
	SNRs and the significant influence of individual subjects. A companion
	paper describes learning curves for four of these 12 data sets, which
	describe an alternative mutual-information prediction metric and
	NPAIRS reproducibility as a function of training-set sizes from 2

	(e.g. controls vs. patients) by proposing three key ideas. First,
	we integrate two goal-directed techniques: coefficient-constrained
	independent component analysis (CC-ICA) and principal component analysis
	with reference (PCA-R), both of which improve sensitivity to group
	differences. Secondly, an automated artifact-removal method is developed
	for selecting components of interest derived from CC-ICA, with an
	average accuracy of 91\%. Finally, we propose a strategy for optimal
	feature/component selection, aiming to identify optimal group-discriminative
	brain networks as well as the tasks within which these circuits are
	engaged. The group-discriminating performance is evaluated on 15
	fMRI feature combinations (5 single features and 10 joint features)
	collected from 28 healthy control subjects and 25 schizophrenia patients.
	Results show that a feature from a sensorimotor task and a joint
	feature from a Sternberg working memory (probe) task and an auditory

	default mode and occipital lobe circuits, which when grouped together

	SM. Cortical reorganization following modified constraint-induced
	movement therapy: a study of 4 patients with chronic stroke.ObjectiveTo
	determine whether cortical changes occur following participation
	in a program of modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT).DesignPre-post,
	case series.SettingOutpatient rehabilitation hospital.ParticipantsTwo
	men and 2 women with unilateral stroke occurring more than 1 year
	prior to study entry and moderate stable motor deficits.InterventionSubjects
	participated in mCIMT, comprised of structured, 30-minute therapy
	sessions emphasizing affected arm use in valued activities, which
	occurred 3 days a week for 10 weeks. Their unaffected arms were restrained
	5 days a week for 5 hours.Main Outcome MeasuresThe Action Research
	Arm Test (ARAT), upper-extremity portion of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment
	(FMA), Motor Activity Log (MAL), and functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (fMRI) at 4T were administered before and after mCIMT.ResultsThree
	subjects exhibited score increases on the MAL, ARAT, and FMA, representing
	increased affected arm use, impairment, and function. These subjects
	reported new ability to perform valued activities with the affected
	hand, such as writing. These subjects also displayed cortical reorganization
	on fMRI. One subject exhibited minimal affected arm use changes,
	modest function changes, and no cortical fMRI changes.ConclusionsIncreased
	affected arm use during mCIMT appears to induce cortical reorganization,
	as measured by fMRI. In patients who responded to mCIMT, cortical
	reorganization was positively related to degree of increase in affected
	arm use and ability. Because mCIMT is more easily administered than
	longer duration protocols, mCIMT may be a more practicable way of
	studying plasticity.}},

	are associated with changes in both brain activity and functional

	In this study we present a method to perform automatic sleep staging
	using only fMRI functional connectivity data, thus providing vigilance
	information while circumventing the technical demands of simultaneous
	recording of EEG, the gold standard for sleep scoring. The features
	to classify are the linear correlation values between 20 cortical
	regions identified using independent component analysis and two regions
	in the bilateral thalamus. The method is based on the construction
	of binary support vector machine classifiers discriminating between
	all pairs of sleep stages and the subsequent combination of them
	into multiclass classifiers. Different multiclass schemes and kernels
	are explored. After parameter optimization through 5-fold cross validation
	we achieve accuracies over 0.8 in the binary problem with functional
	connectivities obtained for epochs as short as 60 s. The multiclass
	classifier generalizes well to two independent datasets (accuracies
	over 0.8 in both sets) and can be efficiently applied to any dataset
	using a sliding window procedure. Modeling vigilance states in resting
	state analysis will avoid confounded inferences and facilitate the
	study of vigilance states themselves. We thus consider the method
	introduced in this study a novel and practical contribution for monitoring
	vigilance levels inside an MRI scanner without the need of extra

	We acquired BOLD fMRI signal during explicit motor sequence learning
	task to characterize the adaptive functional changes in the early
	phase of motor learning. Subjects practiced a 10-digit, visually
	cued, fixed motor sequence during 15 consecutive 30 s practice blocks
	interleaved with similarly cued random sequence blocks. Tensor Independent
	Component Analysis (TICA) decomposed the data into statistically
	independent spatio-temporal processes. Two components were identified
	that represented task-related activations. The first component showed
	decreasing activity of a fronto-parieto-cerebellar network during
	task conditions. The other exclusively related to sequence learning
	blocks showed activation in a network including the posterior parietal
	and premotor cortices. Variation in expression of this component
	across individual subjects correlated with differences in behavior.
	Relative deactivations also were found in patterns similar to those
	described previously as "resting state" networks. Some of these deactivation
	components also showed task- and time-related modulations and were
	related to the behavioral improvement. The spatio-temporal coherence
	within these networks suggests that their elements are functionally
	integrated. Their anatomical plausibility and correlation with behavioral
	measures also suggest that this approach allows characterization
	of the interactions of functional networks relevant to the task.
	Particular value for multi-variant, model-free methods such as TICA
	lies in the potential for generating hypotheses regarding functional
	anatomical networks underlying specific behaviors. {\copyright} 2007

	disorders which ranks among the top causes of worldwide disease burden
	and disability. Recent studies suggested that MDD resulted in the
	functional connectivity alteration in the resting state brain networks,
	such as the emotional circuit and the default mode network (DMN).
	In addition to these emotion-relevant networks, some other brain
	regions, such as cuneus gyrus, lingual gyrus and precuneus gyrus,
	were reported that the activity reduced while performing cognitive
	tasks. In this study, we examined three networks, i.e. the emotional
	circuit, the default mode network, and the whole brain network, derived
	from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
	investigate the difference between MDD patients and normal subjects.
	Furthermore, we explored whether there is another network affected
	by MDD. The functional MRI data was acquired from 22 healthy subjects
	and 20 patients with MDD. All images of each subject were parcellated
	into 90 cortical and sub-cortical regions which were defined as the
	nodes of the network. The functional relations between the 90 regions
	were estimated by the time-frequency normalized mutual information
	(TFNMI). We found that the functional connectivity between any pair
	of brain regions within each of the three networks was significantly
	decreased in MDD group by using the t test. The significantly decreased
	connectivity for MDD in emotional circuit was found in the frontal
	lobe and between the frontal cortex and limbic regions, and that
	in DMN exhibited between the frontal cortex and superior temporal
	cortex. However, in the whole brain network, the most significantly
	decreased connectivity was revealed in occipital lobe, parietal-occipital,

	SOM, mixture model-based clustering and tight clustering have been
	widely used in the literature. Yet no comprehensive comparative study
	has been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods.
	Results: In this paper, six gene clustering methods are evaluated
	by simulated data from a hierarchical log-normal model with various
	degrees of perturbation as well as four real datasets. A weighted
	Rand index is proposed for measuring similarity of two clustering
	results with possible scattered genes (i.e. a set of noise genes
	not being clustered). Performance of the methods in the real data
	is assessed by a predictive accuracy analysis through verified gene
	annotations. Our results show that tight clustering and model-based
	clustering consistently outperform other clustering methods both
	in simulated and real data while hierarchical clustering and SOM
	perform among the worst. Our analysis provides deep insight to the
	complicated gene clustering problem of expression profile and serves
	as a practical guideline for routine microarray cluster analysis.

  abstract = {{In parallel with standard model-based methods for the analysis of
	fMRI data, exploratory methods---such as PCA, ICA, and clustering---have
	been developed to give an account of the dataset with minimal priors:
	no assumption is made on the data content itself, but the data structure
	is assumed to show some properties (decorrelation, independence)
	that allow for the detection of structures of interest. In this paper,
	we present an alternative that tries to take into account some relevant
	knowledge for the analysis of the dataset, e.g., the experimental
	paradigm, while keeping the flexibility of exploratory methods: we
	use a prior temporal modeling of the data that characterizes each
	voxel time course. Two implementations are proposed: one based on
	the General Linear Model, the other one on more flexible short-term
	predictors, whose complexity is controlled by a Minimum Description
	Length approach. However, our main concern here is the construction
	of a multivariate model; the latter is performed with the help of
	a kernel PCA method that builds a redundant representation of the
	data through the nonlinearity of the kernel. This allows for a refinement
	in the description of the (temporal) patterns of interest. In particular,
	this helps in the characterization of subtle variations in the response
	to different experimental conditions. We illustrate the usefulness
	of nonlinearity through the analysis of a synthetic dataset and show
	on a real dataset how it helps to interpret the experimental results.}},

	However, in order to provide clinicians with optimal information,
	the sensitivity and specificity of language fMRI needs to be improved.
	Type II error of failing to reach statistical significance when the
	language activations are genuinely present may be particularly relevant
	to pre-surgical planning, by falsely indicating low surgical risk
	in areas where no activations are shown. Furthermore, since the execution
	of language paradigms involves cognitive processes other than language
	function per se , the conventional general linear model (GLM) method
	may identify non-language-specific activations. In this study, we
	assessed an exploratory approach, independent component analysis
	(ICA), as a potential complementary method to the inferential GLM
	method in language mapping applications. We specifically investigated
	whether this approach might reduce type II error as well as generate
	more language-specific maps. Fourteen right-handed healthy subjects
	were studied with fMRI during two word generation tasks. A similarity
	analysis across tasks was proposed to select components of interest.
	Union analysis was performed on the language-specific components
	to increase sensitivity, and conjunction analysis was performed to
	identify language areas more likely to be essential. Compared with
	GLM, ICA identified more activated voxels in the putative language

  abstract = {{Gaussian random field (GRF)-based methods are commonly used for statistical
	inference and to control the family-wise error rate (FWE) in neuroimaging.
	They require that the error fields are reasonable lattice approximations
	to an underlying continuous multivariate Gaussian random field and
	have differentiable and invertible spatial autocorrelation function.
	Permutation test estimates the distribution of the test statistic
	from the data and adjusts automatically for the FWE. Here we present
	a new analysis procedure, the cluster mass permutation test with
	contextual enhancement (CMPCE), and compare it to GRF. In CMPCE,
	the data are first pre-whitened to remove temporal autocorrelations.
	The FWE rates, the cluster detection probability and delineation
	accuracy of CMPCE and GRF were compared using measured null data
	and null data containing simulated activations. We also applied both
	methods to an fMRI experiment where tactile somatosensory stimulation
	into the right hand was used. When analyzing the FWE using null data,
	both CMPCE and GRF gave significantly higher FWEs (CMPCE up to 0.12,
	GRF up to 0.18) than the nominal significance level 0.05, indicating
	that the pre-whitening, motion correction or high-pass filtering
	partially failed. In the simulated activation data, CMPCE gave less
	falsely classified voxels for the same cluster detection probability
	level than GRF. The maximal cluster detection probability was on
	the other hand higher in the GRF-based method. Both methods gave
	qualitatively similar results in the tactile fMRI data. CMPCE seems
	to be a promising fMRI analysis method, especially if high delineation
	accuracy is required.}},

	resonance imaging (fMRI) are often small compared to the level of

	kinds of motion artifacts and physiological noise with complex patterns.
	This complicates the statistical analysis of the fMRI data. In this
	study, we propose an automatic method to reduce fMRI artifacts based
	on independent component analysis (ICA). We trained a supervised
	classifier to distinguish between independent components relating
	to a potentially task-related signal and independent components clearly
	relating to structured noise. After the components had been classified
	as either signal or noise, a denoised fMR time-series was reconstructed
	based only on the independent components classified as potentially
	task-related. The classifier was a novel global (fixed structure)
	decision tree trained in a Neyman-Pearson (NP) framework, which allowed
	the shape of the decision regions to be controlled effectively. Additionally,
	the conservativeness of the classifier could be tuned by modifying
	the NP threshold. The classifier was tested against the component
	classifications by an expert with the data from a category learning
	task. The test set as well as the expert were different from the
	data used for classifier training and the expert labeling the training
	set. The misclassification rate was between 0.2 and 0.3 for both
	the event-related and blocked designs and it was consistent among
	variety of different NP thresholds. The effects of denoising on the
	group-level statistical analyses were as expected: The denoising
	generally decreased Z-scores in the white matter, where extreme Z-values
	can be expected to reflect artifacts. A similar but weaker decrease
	in Z-scores was observed in the gray matter on average. These two
	observations suggest that denoising was likely to reduce artifacts
	from gray matter and could be useful to improve the detection of
	activations. We conclude that automatic ICA-based denoising offers
	a potentially useful approach to improve the quality of fMRI data

	We use brain functional and structural MRI methods to characterize
	such neural correlates of individual variations in motor learning.
	Healthy subjects applied isometric grip force of varying magnitudes
	with their right hands cued visually to generate smoothly-varying
	pressures following a regular pattern. We tested whether individual
	variations in motor learning were associated with anatomically colocalized
	variations in magnitude of functional MRI (fMRI) signal or in MRI
	differences related to white and grey matter microstructure. We found
	that individual motor learning was correlated with greater functional
	activation in the prefrontal, premotor, and parietal cortices, as
	well as in the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Structural MRI correlates
	were found in the premotor cortex [for fractional anisotropy (FA)]
	and in the cerebellum [for both grey matter density and FA]. The
	cerebellar microstructural differences were anatomically colocalized
	with fMRI correlates of learning. This study thus suggests that variations
	across the population in the function and structure of specific brain
	regions for motor control explain some of the individual differences
	in skill learning. This strengthens the notion that brain structure
	determines some limits to cognitive function even in a healthy population.

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND: To understand the functioning of distributed networks
	such as the brain, it is important to characterize their ability
	to integrate information. The paper considers a measure based on
	effective information, a quantity capturing all causal interactions
	that can occur between two parts of a system. RESULTS: The capacity
	to integrate information, or Phi, is given by the minimum amount
	of effective information that can be exchanged between two complementary
	parts of a subset. It is shown that this measure can be used to identify
	the subsets of a system that can integrate information, or complexes.
	The analysis is applied to idealized neural systems that differ in
	the organization of their connections. The results indicate that
	Phi is maximized by having each element develop a different connection
	pattern with the rest of the complex (functional specialization)
	while ensuring that a large amount of information can be exchanged
	across any bipartition of the network (functional integration). CONCLUSION:
	Based on this analysis, the connectional organization of certain
	neural architectures, such as the thalamocortical system, are well
	suited to information integration, while that of others, such as
	the cerebellum, are not, with significant functional consequences.
	The proposed analysis of information integration should be applicable

  abstract = {{In brains of higher vertebrates, the functional segregation of local
	areas that differ in their anatomy and physiology contrasts sharply
	with their global integration during perception and behavior. In
	this paper, we introduce a measure, called neural complexity (CN),
	that captures the interplay between these two fundamental aspects
	of brain organization. We express functional segregation within a
	neural system in terms of the relative statistical independence of
	small subsets of the system and functional integration in terms of
	significant deviations from independence of large subsets. CN is
	then obtained from estimates of the average deviation from statistical
	independence for subsets of increasing size. CN is shown to be high
	when functional segregation coexists with integration and to be low
	when the components of a system are either completely independent
	(segregated) or completely dependent (integrated). We apply this
	complexity measure in computer simulations of cortical areas to examine
	how some basic principles of neuroanatomical organization constrain
	brain dynamics. We show that the connectivity patterns of the cerebral
	cortex, such as a high density of connections, strong local connectivity
	organizing cells into neuronal groups, patchiness in the connectivity
	among neuronal groups, and prevalent reciprocal connections, are
	associated with high values of CN. The approach outlined here may
	prove useful in analyzing complexity in other biological domains
	such as gene regulation and embryogenesis.}},

  abstract = {{Studies of the cerebral cortex, particularly those of the visual
	system, demonstrate the existence of multiple, anatomically segregated
	and functionally specialized cortical areas. There is no evidence
	that these areas, which are linked by a network of reciprocal connections,
	are coordinated by a higher-order center. The visual image that we
	perceive, however, seems to be unified and coherent. In this article,
	we address the problem of integration posed by these observations.
	In an extension of our previous work, we develop a dynamic model
	of reentry. Reentry is a process of parallel and recursive signaling
	along ordered anatomical connections that achieves integration by
	giving rise to constructive and correlative properties within and
	among maps. We present and test a computer model simulating nine
	functionally segregated visual areas organized into three streams
	for form, color, and motion. The model receives visual input consisting
	of camera images of objects of different shapes and colors. We show
	the specialized response properties of the areas in the three streams.
	A computational strategy involving a phase variable is introduced
	to represent explicitly the dynamics of short-term temporal correlations
	among thousands of units distributed across different areas. We then
	illustrate constructive and correlative consequences of reentry within
	a system of reciprocal intra- and interareal connections by two examples
	taken from psychophysics: generation of form from motion and motion
	capture. The model solves the so-called "binding problem" through
	short-term correlations, which serve to link similar object features
	within a simulated cortical area and to bind multiple attributes
	of one or more objects across several areas, including a nontopographic
	one. Integration emerges from cooperative effects within and among
	the specialized areas. These effects lead to a simple output, a simulated
	foveation response, that is used as a basis for conditioning. Reward
	is mediated by the activation of a saliency system that is modeled
	on diffuse projection systems in the brain. As a result, the visual
	cortical model carries out foveation responses to input stimuli that
	require the dynamic conjunction and discrimination of form, color,
	and location for successful performance.}},

	A fundamental issue is to understand how these networks interact
	and how their activities change during behavioral transitions. Our
	aim was to understand better with functional MRI connectivity how
	the brain switched from a '' resting'' to a movement-related state
	by exploring the transitory readiness state for an intended movement
	of the right hand. Our study does not address movement preparation
	occurring in a time scale of milliseconds before movement which has
	been widely studied but movement-readiness which can last longer.
	At rest, in the absence of overt goal-directed behavior, a '' default-mode''
	network, whose main areas are the posterior cingulate cortex and
	precuneus (PCC/Pcu), shows high activity interpreted as day dreaming,
	free association, stream of consciousness, and inner rehearsal. We
	found that, during rest, the '' default-mode'' network and the sensorimotor
	network were not functionally correlated. During movement-readiness,
	the two networks were functionally correlated through an interaction
	between the PCC/Pcu and the medial superior parietal cortex in the
	upper precuneus. The complex PCC/Pcu has been shown to be involved
	in retrieval and/or setting up spatial attributes for motor imagery,
	and thus, would be a key region in the movement-readiness phase.
	It might functionally connect to the medial superior parietal cortex
	to initiate the movement programming through retrieval of suited
	movement parameters. The anterior cingulum, functionally correlated
	to the primary sensorimotor cortex during movement-readiness would
	have a motivational role or could generate predictions about the

  abstract = {{The default mode network (DMN), based in ventromedial prefrontal
	cortex (vmPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), exhibits higher
	metabolic activity at rest than during performance of externally
	oriented cognitive tasks. Recent studies have suggested that competitive
	relationships between the DMN and various task-positive networks
	involved in task performance are intrinsically represented in the
	brain in the form of strong negative correlations (anticorrelations)
	between spontaneous fluctuations in these networks. Most neuroimaging
	studies characterize the DMN as a homogenous network, thus few have
	examined the differential contributions of DMN components to such
	competitive relationships. Here, we examined functional differentiation
	within the DMN, with an emphasis on understanding competitive relationships
	between this and other networks. We used a seed correlation approach
	on resting-state data to assess differences in functional connectivity
	between these two regions and their anticorrelated networks. While
	the positively correlated networks for the vmPFC and PCC seeds largely
	overlapped, the anticorrelated networks for each showed striking
	differences. Activity in vmPFC negatively predicted activity in parietal
	visual spatial and temporal attention networks, whereas activity
	in PCC negatively predicted activity in prefrontal-based motor control
	circuits. Granger causality analyses suggest that vmPFC and PCC exert
	greater influence on their anticorrelated networks than the other
	way around, suggesting that these two default mode nodes may directly
	modulate activity in task-positive networks. Thus, the two major
	nodes comprising the DMN are differentiated with respect to the specific
	brain systems with which they interact, suggesting greater heterogeneity
	within this network than is commonly appreciated. Hum Brain Mapp

  abstract = {{ Resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) is widely used
	to investigate brain networks that exhibit correlated fluctuations.
	While fcMRI does not provide direct measurement of anatomic connectivity,
	accumulating evidence suggests it is sufficiently constrained by
	anatomy to allow the architecture of distinct brain systems to be
	characterized. fcMRI is particularly useful for characterizing large-scale
	systems that span distributed areas (e.g., polysynaptic cortical
	pathways, cerebro-cerebellar circuits, cortical-thalamic circuits)
	and has complementary strengths when contrasted with the other major
	tool available for human connectomics-high angular resolution diffusion
	imaging (HARDI). We review what is known about fcMRI and then explore
	fcMRI data reliability, effects of preprocessing, analysis procedures,
	and effects of different acquisition parameters across six studies
	(n = 98) to provide recommendations for optimization. Run length
	(2-12 min), run structure (1 12-min run or 2 6-min runs), temporal
	resolution (2.5 or 5.0 s), spatial resolution (2 or 3 mm), and the
	task (fixation, eyes closed rest, eyes open rest, continuous word-classification)
	were varied. Results revealed moderate to high test-retest reliability.
	Run structure, temporal resolution, and spatial resolution minimally
	influenced fcMRI results while fixation and eyes open rest yielded
	stronger correlations as contrasted to other task conditions. Commonly
	used preprocessing steps involving regression of nuisance signals
	minimized nonspecific (noise) correlations including those associated
	with respiration. The most surprising finding was that estimates
	of correlation strengths stabilized with acquisition times as brief
	as 5 min. The brevity and robustness of fcMRI positions it as a powerful
	tool for large-scale explorations of genetic influences on brain
	architecture. We conclude by discussing the strengths and limitations
	of fcMRI and how it can be combined with HARDI techniques to support
	the emerging field of human connectomics. }},

	PO activity we had to deal with general signal changes caused by
	temperature-dependent alterations in the affinity of oxygen for hemoglobin,
	which contributes to BOLD contrast because it is partly sensitive
	to the amount of paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin in the voxel. To reduce
	these overall temperature-induced effects, we corrected the BOLD
	data using brain-specific correction algorithms. The results showed
	activity of the PO during body warming from 38 degrees C to 39 degrees
	C, supported by an increased BOLD signal after correction. This is
	the first fMRI study on the autonomous nervous system in which hypothalamic
	activity elicited by changes in the internal environment (body temperature)
	was monitored. In this study we also demonstrate 1) that any fMRI
	study of anesthetized small animals should guard against background
	BOLD signal drift, since animals are vulnerable to body temperature
	fluctuations; and 2) the existence of a link between PO activity

	amygdala and left anterior insula connectivity in an affective network,
	(2) reduced connectivity of the left frontal pole in a network associated
	with attention and working memory, and (3) decreased bilateral lingual
	gyrus connectivity within ventromedial visual regions. None of these

	Initiative study consisting of CN, aMCI, and AD cohorts with both
	baseline and 12-month follow-up CSF and MRI. The annual change in
	CSF (total-tau [t-tau], Abeta(1-42)) and MRI (change in ventricular
	volume) was obtained in 312 subjects (92 CN, 149 aMCI, 71 AD). RESULTS:
	There was no significant average annual change in either CSF biomarker
	in any clinical group except t-tau in CN; moreover, the annual change
	did not differ by clinical group in pairwise comparisons. In contrast,
	annual increase in ventricular volume increased in the following
	order, AD > aMCI > CN, and differences were significant between all
	clinical groups in pairwise comparisons. Ventricular volume increase
	correlated with concurrent worsening on cognitive/functional indices
	in aMCI and AD whereas evidence of a similar correlation with change
	in CSF measures was unclear. The annual changes in MRI differed by
	APOE epsilon4 status overall and among aMCI while annual changes
	in CSF biomarkers did not. Estimated sample sizes for clinical trials
	are notably less for MRI than the CSF or clinical measures. CONCLUSIONS:
	Unlike the CSF biomarkers evaluated, changes in serial structural
	MRI are correlated with concurrent change on general cognitive and
	functional indices in impaired subjects, track with clinical disease

	visual oddball task. SogICA is particularly suited to the investigation
	of the underlying functional connectivity and does not rely on a

	of hypothesis-driven analysis. Unlike most previous applications
	of ICA in functional imaging, our approach allows the analysis of
	the data at the group level, which is of particular interest in high
	order cognitive studies. SogICA is based on the hierarchical clustering
	of spatially similar independent components, derived from single
	subject decompositions. We identified four main clusters of components,
	centered on the posterior cingulate, bilateral insula, bilateral
	prefrontal cortex, and right posterior parietal and prefrontal cortex,
	consistently across all participants. Post hoc comparison of time
	courses revealed that insula, prefrontal cortex and right fronto-parietal
	components showed higher activity for targets than for distractors.
	Activation for distractors was higher in the posterior cingulate
	cortex, where deactivation was observed for targets. While our results
	conform to previous neuroimaging studies, they also complement conventional
	results by showing functional connectivity networks with unique contributions

	be used to probe functional networks of active cognitive tasks at

	increasingly because it may determine the reaction of the brain to
	external stimuli and task requirements and it is reportedly altered
	in many neurological and psychiatric disorders. In functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI), such functional connectivity is investigated
	commonly by correlating the time course of a chosen "seed voxel"
	with the remaining voxel time courses in a voxel-by-voxel manner.
	This approach is biased by the actual choice of the seed voxel, however,
	because it only shows functional connectivity for the chosen brain
	region while ignoring other potentially interesting patterns of coactivation.
	We used spatial independent component analysis (sICA) to assess cortical
	functional connectivity maps from resting state data. SICA does not
	depend on any chosen temporal profile of local brain activity. We
	hypothesized that sICA would be able to find functionally connected
	brain regions within sensory and motor regions in the absence of
	task-related brain activity. We also investigated functional connectivity
	patterns of several parietal regions including the superior parietal
	cortex and the posterior cingulate gyrus. The components of interest

	volumes of interest. SICA yielded connectivity maps of bilateral
	auditory, motor and visual cortices. Moreover, it showed that prefrontal

	hemispheres during the resting state. These connectivity maps showed
	an extremely high degree of consistency in spatial, temporal, and

	The purpose of this study was to evaluate and examine aspects of

	model is a local model of voxel-by-voxel mean and variance. The second

	extension to the second model. This model is based on robust statistics

	procedure combined with simulations of abnormal perfusion patterns
	was adopted. Abnormal perfusion patterns were simulated at different
	locations in the brain, with different intensities and different
	sizes. The procedure yields receiver operator characteristics (ROC)
	that present a combined measure of model-fit and model-sensitivity
	at detecting abnormalities. The scheme can further be used to compare
	models as well as the influence of different preprocessing steps.
	In particular, the influence of different registration approaches
	is studied and analyzed. The results show that the original non-linear

	experiments in normal subjects suggest that specific regions within
	parietal cortex may also participate in episodic memory. Here we
	examined correlations in spontaneous blood-oxygenation-level-dependent
	(BOLD) signal fluctuations in a resting state to identify the network
	associated with the hippocampal formation (HF) and determine whether
	parietal regions were elements of that network. In the absence of
	task, stimuli, or explicit mnemonic demands, robust correlations
	were observed between activity in the HF and several parietal regions
	(including precuneus, posterior cingulate, retrosplenial cortex,
	and bilateral inferior parietal lobule). These HF-correlated regions
	in parietal cortex were spatially distinct from those correlated
	with the motion-sensitive MT+ complex. Reanalysis of event-related
	fMRI studies of recognition memory showed that the regions spontaneously
	correlated with the HF (but not MT+) were also modulated during directed
	recollection. These regions showed greater activity to successfully
	recollected items as compared with other trial types. Together, these
	results associate specific regions of parietal cortex that are sensitive
	to successful recollection with the HF. 10.1152/jn.00048.2006}},

  abstract = {{Genetic variation at the KIBRA rs17070145 polymorphism has been linked
	to episodic memory, executive function, and Alzheimer's disease (AD),
	which are related to the structural and functional integrity of the
	default-mode network (DMN) and executive control network (ECN). We
	hypothesize that the KIBRA polymorphism could modulate the structure
	and function of the DMN and ECN in healthy young subjects, which
	might underlie the association between this gene and cognitive function.
	To test our hypothesis, we analyzed the resting-state synchronization
	in the DMN and ECN in 288 young, healthy Chinese Han subjects. We
	found that carriers of the KIBRA C-allele demonstrated an increased
	synchronization in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial
	prefrontal cortex (MPFC) of the DMN and in the right anterior insula,
	bilateral caudate nuclei, and bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate
	cortices (dACC) of the ECN compared to individuals with a TT genotype.
	Moreover, KIBRA C-allele carriers also showed a smaller gray matter
	volume (GMV) in the MPFC and bilateral dACCs than TT individuals.
	In contrast, there were no significant genotype differences in the
	synchronization of either the visual network or the sensorimotor
	network. These findings suggest that the polymorphism in the KIBRA
	gene affects GMV and the function of the DMN and ECN. This increased
	synchronization is likely a reflection of compensation for the regional
	gray matter deficits in these networks in young healthy subjects.
	The association between KIBRA polymorphisms and the DMN and ECN should
	be further explored in a healthy older population and in patients

	changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal, R-fMRI offers
	a novel way to assess the brain's spontaneous or intrinsic (i.e.,
	task-free) activity with both high spatial and temporal resolutions.
	The properties of both the intra- and inter-regional connectivity
	of resting-state brain activity have been well documented, promoting
	our understanding of the brain as a complex network. Specifically,
	the topological organization of brain networks has been recently
	studied with graph theory. In this review, we will summarize the
	recent advances in graph-based brain network analyses of R-fMRI signals,
	both in typical and atypical populations. Application of these approaches
	to R-fMRI data has demonstrated non-trivial topological properties
	of functional networks in the human brain. Among these is the knowledge
	that the brain's intrinsic activity is organized as a small-world,
	highly efficient network, with significant modularity and highly
	connected hub regions. These network properties have also been found
	to change throughout normal development, aging, and in various pathological
	conditions. The literature reviewed here suggests that graph-based
	network analyses are capable of uncovering system-level changes associated
	with different processes in the resting brain, which could provide
	novel insights into the understanding of the underlying physiological
	mechanisms of brain function. We also highlight several potential
	research topics in the future.}},

	human brain, and then combined manifold learning and support vector
	machine methods to predict individuals' "brain ages" from rs-fcMRI
	data. We found that age-related changes in interregional functional

	During brain development from childhood to senescence, functional
	connections tended to linearly increase in the emotion system and
	decrease in the sensorimotor system; while quadratic trajectories
	were observed in functional connections related to higher-order cognitive
	functions. The complex patterns of age effect on the whole-brain

	Regression of manifold coordinates with age further showed that the

	mixtures into independent components, each of which contains maximal
	information from a single, independent source of signal, whether
	from noise or from a discrete physiological or neural system. ICA
	typically generates a large number of components for each subject
	imaged, however, and therefore it generates a vast number of components
	across all of the subjects imaged in an fMRI dataset. The practical
	implementation of ICA has been limited by the difficulty in discerning
	which of these many components are spurious and which are reproducible,

	a novel clustering algorithm, termed ldquoPartner-Matchingrdquo (PM),

  number = {5},
  abstract = {{ In this paper, a high-dimensional pattern classification framework,
	based on functional associations between brain regions during resting-state,
	is proposed to accurately identify MCI individuals from subjects
	who experience normal aging. The proposed technique employs multi-spectrum
	networks to characterize the complex yet subtle blood oxygenation
	level dependent (BOLD) signal changes caused by pathological attacks.
	The utilization of multi-spectrum networks in identifying MCI individuals
	is motivated by the inherent frequency-specific properties of BOLD
	spectrum. It is believed that frequency specific information extracted
	from different spectra may delineate the complex yet subtle variations
	of BOLD signals more effectively. In the proposed technique, regional
	mean time series of each region-of-interest (ROI) is band-pass filtered
	([Formula: see text] Hz) before it is decomposed into five frequency
	sub-bands. Five connectivity networks are constructed, one from each
	frequency sub-band. Clustering coefficient of each ROI in relation
	to the other ROIs are extracted as features for classification. Classification
	accuracy was evaluated via leave-one-out cross-validation to ensure
	generalization of performance. The classification accuracy obtained
	by this approach is 86.5\%, which is an increase of at least 18.9\%
	from the conventional full-spectrum methods. A cross-validation estimation
	of the generalization performance shows an area of 0.863 under the
	receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, indicating good diagnostic
	power. It was also found that, based on the selected features, portions
	of the prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, temporal lobe, and
	parietal lobe regions provided the most discriminant information
	for classification, in line with results reported in previous studies.
	Analysis on individual frequency sub-bands demonstrated that different
	sub-bands contribute differently to classification, providing extra
	evidence regarding frequency-specific distribution of BOLD signals.
	Our MCI classification framework, which allows accurate early detection
	of functional brain abnormalities, makes an important positive contribution
	to the treatment management of potential AD patients. }},

	In this study we applied several multidimensional linear regression

	Furthermore, we aimed at clarifying possible causes of anticorrelations

	of regression against the global signal. Our results show that preprocessing
	in general greatly increased connection specificity, in particular

	specificity. However, widespread anticorrelated networks were only
	found when regression against the global signal was applied. Results
	in simulated data sets compared with result of human data strongly
	suggest that anticorrelations are indeed introduced by global signal
	regression and should therefore be interpreted very carefully. In

  abstract = {{Neuroimaging researchers use simulation studies to validate their
	statistical methods because it is acknowledged that this is the most
	feasible way to know the ground truth of the data. The noise model
	used in these studies typically varies from a simple Gaussian distribution
	to an estimate of the noise distribution from real data. However,
	although several studies point out the presence of physiological
	noise in fMRI data, this noise source is currently lacking in simulation
	studies. Therefore, we explored the impact of adding physiological
	noise to the simulated data. For several experimental designs, fMRI
	data were generated under different noise models while the signal-to-noise
	ratio was kept constant. The sensitivity and specificity of a standard
	statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis were determined by
	comparing the known activation with the detected activation. We show
	that by including physiological noise in the data generation process,
	the simulation results in terms of sensitivity and specificity drop
	dramatically. Additionally, we used the new proposed simulation model
	to compare a standard SPM analysis against the method proposed by
	Cabella et al. (2009). The results indicate that the analysis of
	data containing no physiological noise yields a better performance
	of the SPM analysis. However, if physiological noise is included

	accuracy studies.}},
  journal = {BMC medical research methodology},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {6},
  abstract = {{BACKGROUND: A quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies,
	named QUADAS, has recently been developed. Although QUADAS has been
	used in several systematic reviews, it has not been formally validated.
	The objective was to evaluate the validity and usefulness of QUADAS.
	METHODS: Three reviewers independently rated the quality of 30 studies
	using QUADAS. We assessed the proportion of agreements between each
	reviewer and the final consensus rating. This was done for all QUADAS
	items combined and for each individual item. Twenty reviewers who
	had used QUADAS in their reviews completed a short structured questionnaire
	on their experience of QUADAS. RESULTS: Over all items, the agreements
	between each reviewer and the final consensus rating were 91\%, 90\%
	and 85\%. The results for individual QUADAS items varied between
	50\% and 100\% with a median value of 90\%. Items related to uninterpretable
	test results and withdrawals led to the most disagreements. The feedback
	on the content of the tool was generally positive with only small
	numbers of reviewers reporting problems with coverage, ease of use,
	clarity of instructions and validity. CONCLUSION: Major modifications
	to the content of QUADAS itself are not necessary. The evaluation
	highlighted particular difficulties in scoring the items on uninterpretable
	results and withdrawals. Revised guidelines for scoring these items
	are proposed. It is essential that reviewers tailor guidelines for
	scoring items to their review, and ensure that all reviewers are
	clear on how to score studies. Reviewers should consider whether
	all QUADAS items are relevant to their review, and whether additional
	quality items should be assessed as part of their review.}},

  abstract = {{Most models of schizophrenia are based on basal ganglia-thalamocortical
	(BGTC) neuronal circuits or brain structures that project to them.
	Two new neuronal networks have been described which include many
	of the brain regions associated with BGTC neuronal circuits. These
	networks have been characterized with a new brain-imaging technique
	based on low-frequency fluctuations of the blood oxygen level-dependent
	(BOLD) signal. The new network associated with attention-demanding
	tasks is referred to as the task-related network and the network
	associated with stimulus-independent thought during the resting state
	is referred to as the default network. The 2 networks have been proposed
	to be negatively correlated or anticorrelated. This article critically
	reviews the rationale for these anticorrelated networks, the technique
	with which they are characterized, and preliminary findings in schizophrenia
	and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Regions associated with the
	default network overlap with regions important in motivation and
	are activated by memory retrieval, auditory hallucinations, and ketamine.
	Task-related networks are necessary for performance of neurocognitive
	tasks on which schizophrenic patients often perform poorly. It is
	concluded that anticorrelated networks can be viewed as complementary
	ways of understanding self-monitoring and task performance which
	extend present models of schizophrenia based on BGTC circuits. However,
	there are some limitations with regard the present understanding
	of brain structures involved in self-monitoring and the lack of asymmetry
	in the network which may mediate stimulus-independent thought. Further
	investigations of the default network assessed by low-frequency fluctuations
	in the BOLD signal seem warranted. 10.1093/schbul/sbm043}},

  abstract = {{Although progress has been made in relating neuronal events to changes
	in brain metabolism and blood flow, the interpretation of functional
	neuroimaging data in terms of the underlying brain circuits is still
	poorly understood. Computational modeling of connection patterns
	both among and within regions can be helpful in this interpretation.
	We present a neural network model of the ventral visual pathway and
	its relevant functional connections. This includes a new learning
	method that adjusts the magnitude of interregional connections in
	order to match experimental results of an arbitrary functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI) data set. We demonstrate that this method
	finds the appropriate connection strengths when trained on a model
	system with known, randomly chosen connection weights. We then use
	the method for examining fMRI results from a one-back matching task
	in human subjects, both healthy and those with schizophrenia. The
	results discovered by the learning method support previous findings
	of a disconnection between left temporal and frontal cortices in
	the group with schizophrenia and a concomitant increase of right-sided
	temporo-frontal connection strengths. We then demonstrate that the
	disconnection may be explained by reduced local recurrent circuitry
	in frontal cortex. This method extends currently available methods
	for estimating functional connectivity from human imaging data by
	including both local circuits and features of interregional connections,
	such as topography and sparseness, in addition to total connection
	strengths. Furthermore, our results suggest how fronto-temporal functional

  abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based on blood-oxygen
	level dependent (BOLD) contrast today is an established brain research
	method and quickly gains acceptance for complementary clinical diagnosis.
	However, neither the basic mechanisms like coupling between neuronal
	activation and haemodynamic response are known exactly, nor can the
	various artifacts be predicted or controlled. Thus, modeling functional
	signal changes is non-trivial and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
	may be rather useful. In particular, identification and separation
	of artifacts as well as quantification of expected, i.e. stimulus
	correlated, and novel information on brain activity is important
	for both, new insights in neuroscience and future developments in
	functional MRI of the human brain. After an introduction on fuzzy
	clustering and very high-field fMRI we present several examples where
	fuzzy cluster analysis (FCA) of fMRI time series helps to identify
	and locally separate various artifacts. We also present and discuss
	applications and limitations of fuzzy cluster analysis in very high-field
	functional MRI: differentiate temporal patterns in MRI using (a)
	a test object with static and dynamic parts, (b) artifacts due to
	gross head motion artifacts. Using a synthetic fMRI data set we quantitatively
	examine the influences of relevant FCA parameters on clustering results
	in terms of receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) and compare them
	with a commonly used model-based correlation analysis (CA) approach.
	The application of FCA in analyzing in vivo fMRI data is shown for
	(a) a motor paradigm, (b) data from multi-echo imaging, and (c) a
	fMRI study using mental rotation of three-dimensional cubes. We found
	that differentiation of true '' neural'' from false '' vascular''
	activation is possible based on echo time dependence and specific
	activation levels, as well as based on their signal time-course.
	Exploratory data analysis methods in general and fuzzy cluster analysis
	in particular may help to identify artifacts and add novel and unexpected
	information valuable for interpretation, classification and characterization
	of functional MRI data which can be used to design new data acquisition
	schemes, stimulus presentations, neuro(physio)logical paradigms,
	as well as to improve quantitative biophysical models.}},

  abstract = {{BOLD-based functional MRI (fMRI) can be used to explicitly measure
	hemodynamic aspects and functions of human neuro-physiology. As fMRI
	measures changes in regional cerebral blood flow and volume as well
	as blood oxygenation, rather than neuronal brain activity directly,
	other processes that may change the above parameters have to be examined
	closely to assess sensitivity and specificity of fMRI results. Physiological
	processes that can cause artifacts include cardiac action, breathing
	and vasomotion. Although there has been substantial research on physiological
	artifacts and appropriate compensation methods, controversy still
	remains on the mechanisms that cause the fMRI signal fluctuations.
	Respiratory-correlated fluctuations may either be induced by changes
	of the magnetic field homogeneity due to moving organs, intra-thoracic
	pressure differences, respiration-dependent vasodilation or oxygenation
	differences. The aim of this study was to characterize the impact
	of different breathing patterns by varying respiration frequency
	and/or tidal volume on EPI time courses of the resting human brain.
	The amount of respiration-related oscillations during three respiration
	patterns was quantified, and statistically significant differences
	were obtained in white matter only: p < 0.03 between 6 vs. 12 ml/kg
	body weight end tidal volume at a respiration frequency of 15/min,
	p < 0.03 between 12 vs. 6 ml/kg body weight and 15 vs. 10 respiration
	cycles/min. There was no significant difference between 15 vs. 10
	respiration cycles/min at an end tidal volume of 6 ml/kg body weight
	(p = 0.917). In addition, the respiration-affected brain regions
	were very similar with EPI readout in the a-p and l-r direction.
	Based on our results and published literature we hypothesize that
	venous oxygenation oscillations due to changing intra-thoracic pressure
	represent a major factor for respiration-related signal fluctuations
	and increase significantly with increasing end tidal volume in white

	a significant source of low-frequency variation in blood oxygen level-dependent
	(BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal at 3 T arising from
	spontaneous fluctuations in arterial carbon dioxide level in volunteers
	at rest. Fluctuations in the partial pressure of end-tidal carbon
	dioxide (Pet(CO(2))) of +/-1.1 mm Hg in the frequency range 0-0.05
	Hz were observed in a cohort of nine volunteers. Correlating with
	these fluctuations were significant generalized grey and white matter
	BOLD signal fluctuations. We observed a mean (+/-standard error)
	regression coefficient across the group of 0.110 +/- 0.033\% BOLD
	signal change per mm Hg CO(2) for grey matter and 0.049 +/- 0.022\%
	per mm Hg in white matter. Pet(CO(2))-related BOLD signal fluctuations
	showed regional differences across the grey matter, suggesting variability
	of the responsiveness to carbon dioxide at rest. Functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI) results were corroborated by transcranial
	Doppler (TCD) ultrasound measurements of the middle cerebral artery
	(MCA) blood velocity in a cohort of four volunteers. Significant
	Pet(CO(2))-correlated fluctuations in MCA blood velocity were observed
	with a lag of 6.3 +/- 1.2 s (mean +/- standard error) with respect
	to Pet(CO(2)) changes. This haemodynamic lag was adopted in the analysis
	of the BOLD signal. Doppler ultrasound suggests that a component
	of low-frequency BOLD signal fluctuations is mediated by CO(2)-induced
	changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF). These fluctuations are a source
	of physiological noise and a potentially important confounding factor
	in fMRI paradigms that modify breathing. However, they can also be
	used for mapping regional vascular responsiveness to CO(2).}},

	approach can be taken to modelling such data with a general linear
	model (GLM) at each level of the hierarchy introducing different
	random effects variance components. Inferring on these models is
	nontrivial with frequentist solutions being unavailable. A solution
	is to use a Bayesian framework. One important ingredient in this
	is the choice of prior on the variance components and top-level regression
	parameters. Due to the typically small numbers of sessions or subjects
	in neuroimaging, the choice of prior is critical. To alleviate this
	problem, we introduce to neuroimage modelling the approach of reference
	priors, which drives the choice of prior such that it is noninformative

  abstract = {{ In functional magnetic resonance imaging statistical analysis there
	are problems with accounting for temporal autocorrelations when assessing
	change within voxels. Techniques to date have utilized temporal filtering
	strategies to either shape these autocorrelations or remove them.
	Shaping, or "coloring," attempts to negate the effects of not accurately
	knowing the intrinsic autocorrelations by imposing known autocorrelation
	via temporal filtering. Removing the autocorrelation, or "prewhitening,"
	gives the best linear unbiased estimator, assuming that the autocorrelation
	is accurately known. For single-event designs, the efficiency of
	the estimator is considerably higher for prewhitening compared with
	coloring. However, it has been suggested that sufficiently accurate
	estimates of the autocorrelation are currently not available to give
	prewhitening acceptable bias. To overcome this, we consider different
	ways to estimate the autocorrelation for use in prewhitening. After
	high-pass filtering is performed, a Tukey taper (set to smooth the
	spectral density more than would normally be used in spectral density
	estimation) performs best. Importantly, estimation is further improved
	by using nonlinear spatial filtering to smooth the estimated autocorrelation,
	but only within tissue type. Using this approach when prewhitening
	reduced bias to close to zero at probability levels as low as 1 x
	10(-5). Copyright 2001 Academic Press. }},

  abstract = {PET images of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in an activation study are
	usually smoothed to a resolution much poorer than the intrinsic resolution
	of the PET camera. This is done to reduce noise and to overcome problems
	caused by neuroanatomic variability among different subjects undertaking
	the same experimental task. In many studies the choice of this smoothing
	is arbitrarily fixed at about 20 mm FWHM, and the resulting statistical
	field or parametric map is searched for local maxima. Poline and
	Mazoyer [(1994): J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 14:690-699; (1994): IEEE
	Trans Med Imaging 13(4):702-710] have proposed a 4-D search over
	smoothing kernel widths as well as the usual three spatial dimensions.
	If the peaks are well separated then this makes it possible to estimate
	the size of regions of activation as well as their location. One
	of the main problems identified by Poline and Mazoyer is how to assess
	the significance of scale space peaks. In this paper we provide a
	solution for the case of pooled-variance Z-statistic images (Gaussian
	fields). Our main result is a unified P value for the 4-D local maxima
	that is accurate for searches over regions of any shape or size.
	Our results apply equally well to any Gaussian statistical field,

	pattern variability were heritable. We investigated the contributions
	of genetic and environmental factors to both global (brain volume
	and lateral ventricular volume) and regional (parcellated gray matter)
	variability in brain structure. We examined MR images from 10 pairs
	of healthy monozygotic and 10 pairs of same-sex dizygotic twins.
	Regional gray matter volume was estimated by automated image segmentation,
	transformation to standard space, and parcellation using a digital
	atlas. Heritability was estimated by path analysis. Estimated heritability
	for brain volume variability was high (0.66; 95\% confidence interval
	0.17, 1.0) but the major effects on lateral ventricular volume variability
	were common and unique environmental factors. We constructed a map
	of regional brain heritability and found large genetic effects shared
	in common between several bilateral brain regions, particularly paralimbic
	structures and temporal--parietal neocortex. We tested three specific
	hypotheses with regard to the genetic control of brain variability:
	(i) that the strength of the genetic effect is related to gyral ontogenesis,
	(ii) that there is greater genetic control of left than of right
	hemisphere variability, and (iii) that random or fluctuating asymmetry
	in bilateral structures is not heritable. We found no evidence in
	support of the first two hypotheses, but our results were consistent
	with the third hypothesis. Finally, we used principal component (PC)
	analysis of the genetic correlation matrix, to identify systems of
	anatomically distributed gray matter regions which shared major genetic
	effects in common. Frontal and parietal neocortical areas loaded
	positively on the first PC; some paralimbic and limbic areas loaded
	negatively. Bilateral insula, some frontal regions, and temporal
	neocortical regions functionally specialized for audition and language
	loaded strongly on the second PC. We conclude that large samples
	are required for powerful investigation of genetic effects in imaging
	data from twins. However, these preliminary results suggest that
	genetic effects on structure of the human brain are regionally variable
	and predominantly symmetric in paralimbic structures and lateral
	temporal cortex.}},

	MRI (fMRI) signal have been suggested to be associated with functional
	connectivity in brain networks. However, the underlying mechanism
	of this connectivity is still poorly understood, with the synchronized
	fluctuations could either originate from hemodynamic oscillations
	or represent true neuronal signaling. To better interpret the resting
	signal, in the current work, we examined spontaneous fluctuations
	at the level of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygenation (CMRO2), an
	index reflecting regional oxygen consumption and metabolism, and
	thus less sensitive to vascular dynamics. The CMRO2 signal was obtained
	based on a biophysical model with data acquired from simultaneous
	blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) and perfusion signals. CMRO2-based
	functional connectivity maps were generated in three brain networks:
	visual, default-mode, and hippocampus. Experiments were performed
	on twelve healthy participants during 'resting state' and as a comparison,
	with a visual task. CMRO2 signals in each of the above mentioned
	brain networks showed significant correlations. Functional connectivity
	maps from the CMRO2 signal are, in general, similar to those from
	BOLD and perfusion. In addition, we demonstrated that the three parameters
	(M, alpha and beta) in the biophysical model for calculating CMRO2
	have negligible effects on the determination of the CMRO2-based connectivity
	strength. This study provides evidence that the spontaneous fluctuations
	in fMRI at rest likely originate from dynamic changes of cerebral

	However, when they are used in functional brain mapping, the location

	in interpreting the locus of the effect. Here we proposed a hierarchical
	framework of multivariate approach that maps informative clusters
	rather than voxels to achieve reliable functional brain mapping without
	compromising the discriminative power. In particular, we first searched
	for local homogeneous clusters that consisted of voxels with similar
	response profiles. Then, a multi-voxel classifier was built for each
	cluster to extract discriminative information from the multi-voxel
	patterns. Finally, through multivariate ranking, outputs from the
	classifiers were served as a multi-cluster pattern to identify informative
	clusters by examining interactions among clusters. Results from both
	simulated and real fMRI data demonstrated that this hierarchical
	approach showed better performance in the robustness of functional
	brain mapping than traditional voxel-based multivariate methods.
	In addition, the mapped clusters were highly overlapped for two perceptually

	phase fluctuations impairs the validity of currently available solutions
	based on complex datasets. In this article, a time-domain model is
	proposed to generalize the analysis of complex datasets for nonbrain
	regions by incorporating artifacts and phase fluctuations. Based
	on this model, a novel estimation schema has been developed to find
	an appropriate set of voxels in nonbrain regions according to their
	levels of artifact and phase fluctuation. In addition, noise intensity
	from these voxels is estimated. The whole schema is named COmplex-Model-Based
	Estimation (COMBE). Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate
	that the proposed COMBE method provides a better estimation of thermal
	noise in fMRI studies compared with previously proposed methods and
	suggest that the new method can adapt to a broader range of applications,
	such as functional connectivity studies, evaluation of sequence designs
	and reconstruction schemas.}},

	Alternatively, the power of low frequency fluctuation (LFF) may also

	preprocessing, ALFF was obtained by calculating the square root of
	the power spectrum in the frequency range of 0.01-0.08 Hz. Our results
	showed that the ALFF in EO was significantly higher than that in
	EC (P<0.05, corrected) in the bilateral visual cortices. Furthermore,
	the ALFF in EO was significantly reduced in the right paracentral
	lobule (PCL) than in EC (P<0.05, corrected). Region of interest (ROI)
	analysis showed that the ALFF differences between EO and EC were

	were found between EO and EC (P<0.381) in the posterior cingulate
	cortex. All these results agree well with previous studies comparing

  abstract = {{Recently, many researchers have used graph theory to study the aberrant
	brain structures in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and have made great
	progress. However, the characteristics of the cortical network in
	Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are still largely unexplored. In
	this study, the gray matter volumes obtained from magnetic resonance
	imaging (MRI) for all brain regions except the cerebellum were parcellated
	into 90 areas using the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template
	to construct cortical networks for 98 normal controls (NCs), 113
	MCIs and 91 ADs. The measurements of the network properties were
	calculated for each of the three groups respectively. We found that
	all three cortical networks exhibited small-world properties and
	those strong interhemispheric correlations existed between bilaterally
	homologous regions. Among the three cortical networks, we found the
	greatest clustering coefficient and the longest absolute path length
	in AD, which might indicate that the organization of the cortical
	network was the least optimal in AD. The small-world measures of
	the MCI network exhibited intermediate values. This finding is logical
	given that MCI is considered to be the transitional stage between
	normal aging and AD. Out of all the between-group differences in
	the clustering coefficient and absolute path length, only the differences
	between the AD and normal control groups were statistically significant.
	Compared with the normal controls, the MCI and AD groups retained
	their hub regions in the frontal lobe but showed a loss of hub regions
	in the temporal lobe. In addition, altered interregional correlations
	were detected in the parahippocampus gyrus, medial temporal lobe,
	cingulum, fusiform, medial frontal lobe, and orbital frontal gyrus
	in groups with MCI and AD. Similar to previous studies of functional
	connectivity, we also revealed increased interregional correlations
	within the local brain lobes and disrupted long distance interregional
	correlations in groups with MCI and AD. Understanding the progression
	of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential. We investigated networks
	of cortical connectivity along a continuum from normal to AD. Mild
	Cognitive Impairment (MCI) has been implicated as transitional between
	normal aging and AD. By investigating the characteristics of cortical
	networks in these three stages (normal, MCI and AD), we found that
	all three networks exhibited small-world properties. These properties
	indicate efficient information transfer in the human brain. We also
	found that the small-world measures of the MCI network were intermediate
	to those of the normal controls and the patients with AD. This supports
	the opinion that MCI is a transitional stage between normal aging
	and AD. Additionally, we found altered interregional correlations
	in patients with MCI and AD, which may indicate that a compensatory
	system interacts with cerebral atrophy. The presence of compensatory
	mechanisms in patients with MCI and AD may enable them to use additional
	cognitive resources to function on a more nearly normal level. In
	future, we need to integrate the multi-level network features obtained
	with various functional and anatomical brain imaging technologies
	on different scales to understand the pathophysiological mechanism
	of MCI and AD. We propose brainnetome to represent such integration
	framework.}},

  abstract = {{ Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves interactions
	among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain
	areas form local hierarchical relations such as within the visual
	system. Other connectivity patterns, particularly among association
	areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits without clear
	hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks
	in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional
	connectivity MRI. Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using
	surface-based alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify
	and replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the
	cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to
	sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association
	regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity
	followed topographic representations across adjacent areas. In association
	cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions
	between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better
	understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor
	pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area
	complex (MT+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field
	was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between
	networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the MT+ complex
	demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical
	pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal
	and prefrontal association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity
	profiles of neighboring regions suggest they participate in distributed
	networks that, while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded
	within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by
	discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks
	in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion
	in humans to support cognition. }},

  abstract = {{A new MRI simulator has been developed that generates images of realistic
	objects for arbitrary pulse sequences executed in the presence of
	static field inhomogeneities, including those due to magnetic susceptibility,
	variations in the applied field, and chemical shift. In contrast
	to previous simulators, this system generates object-specific inhomogeneity
	patterns from first principles and propagates the consequent frequency
	offsets and intravoxel dephasing through the acquisition protocols
	to produce images with realistic artifacts. The simulator consists
	of two parts. The input to part 1 is a set of '' susceptibility voxels''
	that describe the magnetic properties of the object being imaged.
	It calculates a frequency offset for each voxel by computing the
	size of the static field offset at each voxel in the image based
	on the magnetic susceptibility of each tissue type within all voxels.
	The method of calculation is a three-dimensional convolution of the
	susceptibility-voxels with a kernel derived from a previously published
	method and takes advantage of the superposition principle to include
	voxels with mixtures of substances of differing susceptibilities.
	Part 2 produces both a signal and a reconstructed image. Its inputs
	include a voxel-based description of the object, frequency offsets
	computed by part 1, applied static field errors, chemical shift values,
	and a description of the imaging protocol. Intravoxel variations
	in both static field and time-dependent phase are calculated for
	each voxel. Validations of part 1 are presented for a known analytic
	solution and for experimental data from two phantoms. Part 2 was

  abstract = {{10.1093/bioinformatics/btm463 Motivation: Consensus clustering, also
	known as cluster ensemble, is one of the important techniques for
	microarray data analysis, and is particularly useful for class discovery
	from microarray data. Compared with traditional clustering algorithms,
	consensus clustering approaches have the ability to integrate multiple
	partitions from different cluster solutions to improve the robustness,
	stability, scalability and parallelization of the clustering algorithms.
	By consensus clustering, one can discover the underlying classes
	of the samples in gene expression data.Results: In addition to exploring
	a graph-based consensus clustering (GCC) algorithm to estimate the
	underlying classes of the samples in microarray data, we also design
	a new validation index to determine the number of classes in microarray
	data. To our knowledge, this is the first time in which GCC is applied
	to class discovery for microarray data. Given a pre specified maximum
	number of classes (denoted as Kmax in this article), our algorithm
	can discover the true number of classes for the samples in microarray
	data according to a new cluster validation index called the Modified
	Rand Index. Experiments on gene expression data indicate that our
	new algorithm can (i) outperform most of the existing algorithms,
	(ii) identify the number of classes correctly in real cancer datasets,
	and (iii) discover the classes of samples with biological meaning.Availability:
	Matlab source code for the GCC algorithm is available upon request

	statistic (NBS) and spatial pairwise clustering (SPC) are two distinct
	methods that have been used to control family-wise errors when assessing
	the evidence for an experimental effect with mass univariate testing.
	The basic principle of the NBS and SPC is the same as supra-threshold
	voxel clustering. Unlike voxel clustering, where the definition of
	a voxel cluster is unambiguous, 'clusters' formed among supra-threshold
	connections can be defined in different ways. The NBS defines clusters
	using the graph theoretical concept of connected components. SPC
	on the other hand uses a more stringent pairwise clustering concept.
	The purpose of this article is to compare the pros and cons of the
	NBS and SPC, provide some guidelines on their practical use and demonstrate
	their utility using a case study involving neuroimaging data. \^{a}º
	Methods are presented for identifying connectivity differences in

	many interconnected brain regions. \^{a}º Other method (SPC) is

  abstract = {{Independent component analysis (ICA) is a data-driven approach to
	study functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Particularly,
	for group analysis on multiple subjects, temporally concatenation
	group ICA (TC-GICA) is intensively used. However, due to the usually
	limited computational capability, data reduction with principal component
	analysis (PCA: a standard preprocessing step of ICA decomposition)
	is difficult to achieve for a large dataset. To overcome this, TC-GICA
	employs multiple-stage PCA data reduction. Such multiple-stage PCA
	data reduction, however, leads to variable outputs due to different
	subject concatenation orders. Consequently, the ICA algorithm uses
	the variable multiple-stage PCA outputs and generates variable independent
	component decompositions. In this study, a rigorous theoretical analysis
	was conducted to prove the existence of such variability. Simulated

	To solve this problem, we propose a new subject order-independent

  abstract = {{As functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) becomes widely used,
	the demands for evaluation of fMRI processing pipelines and validation
	of fMRI analysis results is increasing rapidly. The current NPAIRS
	package, an IDL-based fMRI processing pipeline evaluation framework,
	lacks system interoperability and the ability to evaluate general
	linear model (GLM)-based pipelines using prediction metrics. Thus,
	it can not fully evaluate fMRI analytical software modules such as
	FSL.FEAT and NPAIRS.GLM. In order to overcome these limitations,
	a Java-based fMRI processing pipeline evaluation system was developed.
	It integrated YALE (a machine learning environment) into Fiswidgets
	(a fMRI software environment) to obtain system interoperability and
	applied an algorithm to measure GLM prediction accuracy. The results
	demonstrated that the system can evaluate fMRI processing pipelines
	with univariate GLM and multivariate canonical variates analysis
	(CVA)-based models on real fMRI data based on prediction accuracy
	(classification accuracy) and statistical parametric image (SPI)
	reproducibility. In addition, a preliminary study was performed where
	four fMRI processing pipelines with GLM and CVA modules such as FSL.FEAT
	and NPAIRS.CVA were evaluated with the system. The results indicated
	that (1) the system can compare different fMRI processing pipelines
	with heterogeneous models (NPAIRS.GLM, NPAIRS.CVA and FSL.FEAT) and
	rank their performance by automatic performance scoring, and (2)
	the rank of pipeline performance is highly dependent on the preprocessing
	operations. These results suggest that the system will be of value
	for the comparison, validation, standardization and optimization

	were also acquired during the resting-state to investigate the synchronization
	of low frequency fluctuations (LFF) in the BOLD signal (< 0.08 Hz)

	to be synchronized between functionally related brain regions in

	in Alzheimer's disease) and the Default Mode Network (disrupted in
	Alzheimer's disease but enhanced in behavioural variant frontotemporal
	dementia). With task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging,
	we tested these ideas in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia,
	Alzheimer's disease and healthy age-matched controls (n = 12 per
	group), using independent component analyses to generate group-level
	network contrasts. As predicted, behavioural variant frontotemporal
	dementia attenuated Salience Network connectivity, most notably in
	frontoinsular, cingulate, striatal, thalamic and brainstem nodes,
	but enhanced connectivity within the Default Mode Network. Alzheimer's
	disease, in contrast, reduced Default Mode Network connectivity to
	posterior hippocampus, medial cingulo-parieto-occipital regions and
	the dorsal raphe nucleus, but intensified Salience Network connectivity.
	Specific regions of connectivity disruption within each targeted
	network predicted intrinsic connectivity enhancement within the reciprocal
	network. In behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, clinical
	severity correlated with loss of right frontoinsular Salience Network
	connectivity and with biparietal Default Mode Network connectivity
	enhancement. Based on these results, we explored whether a combined
	index of Salience Network and Default Mode Network connectivity might
	discriminate between the three groups. Linear discriminant analysis
	achieved 92\% clinical classification accuracy, including 100\% separation
	of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
	Patients whose clinical diagnoses were supported by molecular imaging,
	genetics, or pathology showed 100\% separation using this method,
	including four diagnostically equivocal 'test' patients not used
	to train the algorithm. Overall, the findings suggest that behavioural
	variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease lead to divergent
	network connectivity patterns, consistent with known reciprocal network
	interactions and the strength and deficit profiles of the two disorders.
	Further developed, intrinsic connectivity network signatures may
	provide simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive biomarkers for dementia
	differential diagnosis and disease monitoring.}},

	hybridization studies has proved to be a useful tool for identifying

	capacity to measure a general dependence among gene random variables.
	We propose a novel clustering strategy based on minimizing mutual

	to solve the optimization problem. Bootstrap techniques are employed
	to get more accurate estimates of mutual information when the data

	Euclidean distance and the fuzzy membership metric in designing the
	clustering algorithm. The performances of the new clustering methods

	Compared to healthy volunteers, patients showed significant differences

	in the connectivities associated with the bilateral dorsal medial
	prefrontal cortex, the lateral parietal region, the inferior temporal
	gyrus of the "task-negative" network and with the right dorsolateral

	automatic quantification of multiple sclerosis lesion load in MRI,
	in the context of a phase III clinical trial. The pipeline results
	were evaluated through an extensive validation study, revealing that
	the obtained lesion measurements are statistically indistinguishable
	from those obtained by trained human observers. Given that intra-

  abstract = {{Functional connectivity analyses of resting-state fMRI data are rapidly
	emerging as highly efficient and powerful tools for in vivo mapping
	of functional networks in the brain, referred to as intrinsic connectivity
	networks (ICNs). Despite a burgeoning literature, researchers continue
	to struggle with the challenge of defining computationally efficient
	and reliable approaches for identifying and characterizing ICNs.
	Independent component analysis (ICA) has emerged as a powerful tool
	for exploring ICNs in both healthy and clinical populations. In particular,
	temporal concatenation group ICA (TC-GICA) coupled with a back-reconstruction
	step produces participant-level resting state functional connectivity
	maps for each group-level component. The present work systematically
	evaluated the test--retest reliability of TC-GICA derived RSFC measures
	over the short-term (< 45 min) and long-term (5--16 months). Additionally,
	to investigate the degree to which the components revealed by TC-GICA
	are detectable via single-session ICA, we investigated the reproducibility
	of TC-GICA findings. First, we found moderate-to-high short- and
	long-term test--retest reliability for ICNs derived by combining
	TC-GICA and dual regression. Exceptions to this finding were limited
	to physiological- and imaging-related artifacts. Second, our reproducibility
	analyses revealed notable limitations for template matching procedures
	to accurately detect TC-GICA based components at the individual scan
	level. Third, we found that TC-GICA component's reliability and reproducibility
	ranks are highly consistent. In summary, TC-GICA combined with dual
	regression is an effective and reliable approach to exploratory analyses
	of resting state fMRI data.}},

	human brain: Preprocessing, scan duration, imaging resolution and
	computational space}},
  journal = {NeuroImage},
  year = {2012},
  month = oct,
  abstract = {{While researchers have extensively characterized functional connectivity
	between brain regions, the characterization of functional homogeneity
	within a region of the brain connectome is in early stages of development.
	Several functional homogeneity measures were proposed previously,
	among which regional homogeneity (ReHo) was most widely used as a
	measure to characterize functional homogeneity of resting state fMRI
	(R-fMRI) signals within a small region (Zang et al., 2004). Despite
	a burgeoning literature on ReHo in the field of neuroimaging brain
	disorders, its test--retest (TRT) reliability remains unestablished.
	Using two sets of public R-fMRI TRT data, we systematically evaluated
	the ReHo's TRT reliability and further investigated the various factors
	influencing its reliability and found: 1) nuisance (head motion,
	white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid) correction of R-fMRI time
	series can significantly improve the TRT reliability of ReHo while
	additional removal of global brain signal reduces its reliability,
	2) spatial smoothing of R-fMRI time series artificially enhances
	ReHo intensity and influences its reliability, 3) surface-based R-fMRI
	computation largely improves the TRT reliability of ReHo, 4) a scan
	duration of 5 min can achieve reliable estimates of ReHo, and 5)
	fast sampling rates of R-fMRI dramatically increase the reliability
	of ReHo. Inspired by these findings and seeking a highly reliable
	approach to exploratory analysis of the human functional connectome,
	we established an R-fMRI pipeline to conduct ReHo computations in
	both 3-dimensions (volume) and 2-dimensions (surface). \^{a}º Regional
	homogeneity (ReHo) is highly test--retest reliable. \^{a}º Motion
	and non-brain tissue correction significantly improve the ReHo's
	reliability. \^{a}º Global brain signal regression significantly
	reduces the ReHo's reliability. \^{a}º 5 min scan duration is enough
	to achieve reliable ReHo estimates. \^{a}º Surface-based analysis
	produces highly reliable ReHo measures. \^{a}º Multi-band EPI resting-state
	brain dramatically increases the reliability of ReHo.}},

	reduction of these correlated noise sources. The method allows model-free
	estimation of the correlated noise from brain regions not activated
	by the functional paradigm using a short (1-2 min) reference scan.
	A single regressor representing this noise-source estimate is added
